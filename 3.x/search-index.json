Parity Technologies Limited (\"Parity\") is a company registered in England and Wales under company number 09760015 with its registered office at c/o Ignition Law, 1 Sans Walk, London, England, EC1R 0LT. Understanding these Terms of Use​ These terms of use (together with the documents referred to in it) (the “Terms”) describe the terms and conditions that apply to the ink!ubator Program. By submitting your application to the ink!ubator Program you accept these Terms and agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms, you must not participate in the ink!ubator Program. When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific meanings (these are known as \"defined terms\"). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of these Terms where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in speech marks). In these Terms, when we refer to \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\", we mean Parity, and when we refer to \"you\" or \"your\" we mean the person, company and/or team engaging with or participating in ink!ubator. In addition to these Terms, please note the following additional terms also apply: Our Privacy Policy, which sets out information about how we use your personal information and the use of cookies and local storage on our sites. Our Website Terms of Use, which sets out the terms on how you may access, browse, use and interact with our websites. About the ink!ubator Program​ The ink!ubator Program objective is to identify, support and mentor current and potential ink!-related projects within the ecosystem. By participating in the ink!ubator Program you will receive support from us on technical, community, funding and strategy matters, among others, and may be eligible for Awards and Benefits (defined below). Participation, progress and successful completion of the ink!ubator Program is measured on a milestone basis (the “Milestones”). Milestones components and deliverables vary depending on each project and team. Successful completion of Milestones will be evaluated by Curators (defined below) at each Milestones review meeting. You understand and acknowledge that Milestones are a core component of the program as they work as a guide to determine a project progress and success and that not meeting the Milestones deliverables and/or participating in the Milestones review meetings could result in you exiting ink!ubator. ink!ubator Awards and Benefits​ ink!ubator Program will award and provide benefits to eligible teams on a per Milestone completion basis (respectively, the “Awards” and “Benefits“). This means that upon successful completion of each Milestone you might be eligible for Awards and Benefits. Awards may include our assistance in securing you a financial grant from our partner organisation and Benefits may consist of external code audits, Amazon cloud credits and talent sourcing support, among others. You acknowledge and understand that we may change, update, modify, add or remove the availability of Awards and Benefits at our sole discretion and without prior notification. Curators will endeavour to provide fair, clear and transparent feedback to you on Milestones progress and completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Curators reserve the right to allocate ink!ubator Awards and Benefits as they deem fit and appropriate, evaluating Milestone progress and success at their own discretion. Availability and eligibility of Awards and Benefits may depend on your location, country of residence and other conditions as set forth in applicable laws and regulations. You agree to cooperate and provide us and/or our Awards and Benefits partners and sponsors with all relevant, accurate and updated information about you, your team and your company as is necessary to evaluate if you are eligible for a specific Award and/or Benefit. Failure to provide such information may prevent you from receiving Awards and Benefits. In the event that you are not eligible for an Award or Benefit, for whatever reason, Curators are under no obligation to offer an alternative Award or Benefit. You also acknowledge and understand that certain Awards and Benefits may require you to accept or be subject to third parties specific terms of use, policies and conditions and that you will comply with them at all times.

These are the types that ink! uses, if no explicit steps are taken: /// The fundamental types of the default configuration. #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)] #[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(TypeInfo))] pub enum DefaultEnvironment {} impl Environment for DefaultEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 4; type AccountId = ink_primitives::AccountId; type Balance = u128; type Hash = ink_primitives::Hash; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = NoChainExtension; } The context here is that you can use ink! on any blockchain that was built with the Substrate framework and includes the pallet-contracts module. Chains built on Substrate can decide on their own which types they want to use for e.g. the chain's block number or account id's. For example, chains that intend to be compatible to Ethereum typically use the same type as Ethereum for their AccountId. Most Substrate chains stay with the default Substrate types though and ink! just uses those by default as well. It is possible to configure a different environment in the contract macro (documentation here) though: #[ink::contract(env = MyCustomTypes)] Edit this page Previous Environment Functions Next Metadata","s":"Chain Environment Types","u":"/5.x/basics/chain-environment-types","h":"","p":379},{"i":382,"t":"Version: 5.0-rc On this page Contract Debugging There are three ways to debug your ink! contract currently: You can write tests using one of the mechanisms described on the Contract Testing page. You can interact with your contract via a UI or command-line. This is described on the Call Your Contract page. You can print debug statements in your contract. Those will appear on the Substrate node's stdout. This is described on this page. How do I print to the terminal console from ink!?​ You can use those two macros: ink::env::debug_println! ink::env::debug_print! There are things you could do to enable debug messages on the client console: Enable the feature ink-debug for the ink_env crate. cargo-contract does this automatically for you (for versions >= 0.13.0), except if you compile a contract in --release mode. Set the log level of your node to runtime::contracts=debug. For example, to have only errors and debug output show up for the substrate-contracts-node: substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug Set the log level of your node to runtime::contracts::strace to trace host function calls. These function calls logs will also be displayed in the Debug message panel of Contracts UI. For example, to view these traces in addition to the logs described above: substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug,runtime::contracts::strace=trace Example​ The following code depicts how to print debug statements from a message or constructor. #[ink(constructor)] fn new() -> Self { ink::env::debug_println!(\"created new instance at {}\", Self::env().block_number()); Self { } } #[ink(message)] fn print(&self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let message = ink_prelude::format!(\"got a call from {:?}\", caller); ink::env::debug_println!(&message); } note Debug output is not printed for transactions! It is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests. Decode Data Payload You can use a block explorer or an app like PolkadotJs to retrieve the data payload of a contract transaction, and then use cargo-contract to decode it. # From your contract directory cargo contract decode message -d fe5bd8ea01000000 This command will output the method name and parameters encoded in the data payload: Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 } If the contract was called through a cross-contract interaction, the payload will not be available in the transaction. In such cases, you can use the approach described in the next section to access it. Replay and Debug a Block To replay a transaction, you can use Chopstick to create a local fork of the chain and replay the block with trace-level logging. Assuming you have a node that you can connect to at $ENDPOINT and the transaction you want to replay is in block $BLOCK_HASH, you can use the following command: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest run-block \\ --endpoint $ENDPOINT \\ --block $BLOCK_HASH \\ --runtime-log-level 5 \\ | grep runtime::contracts This command replays the block with trace-level logging enabled. By filtering the output with runtime::contracts, you can view all the contract calls in the block: runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [246, 118, 44, 201] runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0] runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } From here, you can identify the call you are interested in and decode the data payload: echo 254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0 \\ | tr ',' ' ' \\ | xargs printf '%02x' \\ | xargs cargo contract decode message -d This command will output the following: Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 } Fork Node and Replay Transactions You can also use Chopstick to start a local fork of your chain. This command starts a fork beginning at block $BLOCK_HASH. You can connect to this fork using ws://localhost:8000 to submit extrinsics via PolkadotJs or cargo contract: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest \\ --endpoint $ENDPOINT \\ --block $BLOCK_HASH \\ --runtime-log-level 5 Here, for example, you can re-run the transaction that we decoded in the previous section: cargo contract call \\ --contract $CONTRACT_ADDR \\ --message inc_by --args 1 \\ --suri //Alice \\ --url ws://localhost:8000 Since trace-level logging is used, you will receive detailed information about all the host functions called during the execution of the contract: runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 2, 0, 0, 0] runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } runtime::contracts DEBUG: Execution finished with debug buffer: seal0::value_transferred(out_ptr: 65488, out_len_ptr: 65516) = Ok(()) seal0::input(out_ptr: 65536, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(()) seal1::get_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, out_ptr: 65540, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(Success) seal2::set_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, value_ptr: 65540, value_len: 4) = Ok(4) seal0::seal_return(flags: 0, data_ptr: 65536, data_len: 1) = Err(TrapReason::Return(ReturnData { flags: 0, data: [0] })) Edit this page How do I print to the terminal console from ink!?

This way of testing resembles closely how the contract will actually behave in production. As part of the test, the contract will be compiled and deployed to a Substrate node that is running in the background. ink! offers API functions that enable developers to then interact with the contract via transactions that they create and submit to the blockchain. You as a developer can define assertions on the outcome of their transactions, such as checking for state mutations, transaction failures or incurred gas costs. Your chain configuration will be tested together with the smart contract. And if your chain has pallets that are involved with the smart contract execution, those will be part of the test execution as well. ink! does not put any requirements on the Substrate node in the background – for example, you can run a node that contains a snapshot of a live network. Example​ The following code example illustrates a basic E2E test for the flipper example. #[ink_e2e::test] async fn default_works<Client: E2EBackend>(mut client: Client) -> E2EResult<()> { // When the function is entered, the contract was already // built in the background via `cargo contract build`. // The `client` object exposes an interface to interact // with the Substrate node. // given let mut constructor = FlipperRef::new_default(); // when let contract = client .instantiate(\"flipper\", &ink_e2e::bob(), &mut constructor) .submit() .await .expect(\"instantiate failed\"); let call_builder = contract.call_builder::<Flipper>(); // then let get = call_builder.get(); let get_res = client.call(&ink_e2e::bob(), &get).dry_run().await?; assert!(matches!(get_res.return_value(), false)); Ok(()) } You can run the above test by going to the flipper folder in the ink! examples directory. Before you can run the test, you have to install a Substrate node with pallet-contracts. By default e2e tests require that you install substrate-contracts-node. You do not need to run it in the background since the node is started for each test independently. To install the latest version: cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git If you want to run any other node with pallet-contracts you need to change CONTRACTS_NODE environment variable: export CONTRACTS_NODE=\"YOUR_CONTRACTS_NODE_PATH\" And finally execute the following command to start e2e test execution. cargo test --features e2e-tests Edit this page Previous DRink!

Version: 5.0-rc On this page DRink! Apart from the core ink! testing framework, Aleph Zero also provides the DRink! library. It offers an intermediate solution between integration and E2E testing. Intuitively, DRink! maintains a full in-memory blockchain state and allows you to interact with it directly. This gives a notably robust methodology in contrast to the off-chain engine facilitated by the ink::test macro. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that the absence of the entire node layer makes the environment less realistic compared to the comprehensive setup employed in the end-to-end tests. Comparison to the other testing strategies​ To better assess when DRink! performs better than other testing methods, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the consequences of its unique design and the trade-offs it entails. Speed: since DRink! doesn't spawn any node or background process, everything happens locally, within the testing thread. This means that the execution can be synchronous and significantly faster than the E2E tests. Therefore, its performance should be comparable to the unit or integration testing. Also, there is no block production or finalization delay, which is a noticeable factor in the E2E tests. Thanks to that, we can launch long-running simulations in a reasonable time. Testing multiple contracts: since we are working with a full blockchain state, we can perform any interaction with the contracts, which includes working with mutliple contracts at the same time. Of course, this is the same as in the E2E tests, but it is not possible in either the unit or integration tests. Working with arbitrary runtimes: similarly to the E2E tests, where we can spawn any node with customized runtime (Polkadot's term for the state transition function), in DRink! tests we can work with any blockchain runtime we want. Full control over runtime state: we hold the state of the blockchain and exercise full control over it, so we can easily manipulate it however we want. This covers manipulating block number, timestamp, account balances, etc. Some of these are also possible in the E2E tests, but usually they require more effort or overhead. Powerful features: thanks to the unique design of DRink!, we can easily take advantage of some powerful, not available in other testing strategies, features: contract mocking: you can mock any contract or message you want, specifying the default behavior or the exact return value. enhanced debugging and call tracing: you can get more insights into the contract execution process, like stack trace, debug buffers and more. Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks of DRink! as well: No node layer: since we don't spawn any node, we don't have access to the node layer, which means that we can't test any node-related functionality, like RPC calls, block production, etc. Artificial, isolated environment: this is the main trade-off of DRink!. It might give a false sense of security, while in the real environment, the contract could behave differently. The discrepancy can be mitigated by a careful and precise simulation and setup of the environment, but it is still a factor to consider. No typed contract API: currently, DRink! works with string-encoded arguments and values, which means that we lose the type safety and convenience that was present in the other testing frameworks. Fortunately, this is going to change soon, as there is an ongoing effort to integrate it with ink-wrapper library. When to use DRink!?​ Usually, DRink! is a good choice for the development phase of your project. When the iteration speed is crucial, and you want to quickly test your contracts, DRink! will offer a versatile, yet highly efficient testing environment. However, you must not forget that it is not a replacement for the E2E tests, which should be run before the deployment to the production network, as well as in your CI/CD pipelines. DRink! also comes in handy when you need to: mock some parts of your contract suite debug the execution process launch long-running simulations, that would normally take a lot of time when relying on a real block-time How to use DRink!?​ There are three ways to use DRink!: Directly as a library​ This way you gain access to full DRink! power in your test suites. drink library is continuously published to crates.io, so you can use it in your project with either cargo add drink or by adding the following line to your Cargo.toml: drink = { version = \"0.8\" } Then, you can write your tests like this: #[cfg(test)] mod tests { /// This will take care of building all contract dependencies in the compilation phase and gather all contract /// bundles (metadata and the compiled code) into a single registry. #[drink::contract_bundle_provider] enum BundleProvider {} /// Within `drink::test` macro, you are provided with a `session` object, which is a wrapper around the /// blockchain state. You can use it to deploy contracts, call their methods, and more. #[drink::test] fn deploy_and_call_a_contract(mut session: Session) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> { let result: bool = sesison .deploy_bundle_and(BundleProvider::local(), \"new\", &[\"true\"], NO_SALT, NO_ENDOWMENT)? .call_and(\"flip\", NO_ARGS, NO_ENDOWMENT)? .call_and(\"flip\", NO_ARGS, NO_ENDOWMENT)? .call_and(\"flip\", NO_ARGS, NO_ENDOWMENT)? .call(\"get\", NO_ARGS, NO_ENDOWMENT)??; assert_eq!(result, false); } } You can check some helpful and verbose examples here, including the quick start guide. As an alternative backend to ink!'s E2E testing framework​ DRink! is already integrated with the ink! framework and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard E2E testing environment. Just use corresponding argument in the test macro: #[ink_e2e::test(backend(runtime_only()))] to your test function and you have just switched from E2E testcase to DRink!-based one, that doesn't use any running node in the background! For a full example check out ink! repository. With a command line tool​ We provide a CLI which puts DRink! behind friendly TUI. For more details, consult its README.

See the flipper example. Integration Tests For integration tests, the test is annotated with our #[ink::test] attribute instead of #[test]. Our attribute denotes that the test is then executed in a simulated, mocked blockchain environment. here are functions available to influence how the test environment is configured (e.g. setting a specified balance of an account to simulate how a contract would behave when interacting with it). If you annotate a test with the #[ink::test] attribute it will be executed in a simulated environment, similar to as it would be run on-chain. You then have fine-grained control over how a contract is called; for example you can influence the block advancement, the value transferred to it, by which account it is called, which storage it is run with, etc.. See the examples/erc20 contract on how to utilize those or the documentation for details. At the moment there are some known limitations to our off-chain environment, and we are working on making it behave as close to the real chain environment as possible. note One limitation of the off-chain testing framework is that it currently only supports a DefaultEnvironment. See here for an explanation of what an environment is. How do you find out if your test requires the off-chain environment?​ Normally if the test recursively uses or invokes some contract methods that call a method defined in self.env() or Self::env().

We'll take a snapshot of an existing chain for this purpose. The snapshot contains the chains full state, but can be modified locally without affecting the live chain. We'll use the Chopsticks tool for this purpose. This is a powerful workflow that you can use to e.g. Test a contract upgrade or migration locally before running it in production. Debug the behavior of an on-chain contract with on-chain state locally. Get detailed debug info and replay blocks as you want. …and much more! In the first section of this page we explain the general concept, using a local substrate-contracts-node that will play the role of our \"live chain\". The substrate-contracts-node is just for exemplary purposes, you can also apply the exact same workflow to production chains like Astar, Aleph Zero, Pendulum and others. General Concept​ First you need a node that has produced some blocks with state. We'll use substrate-contracts-node for this purpose. See here for how to run it. You should get output similar to: $ substrate-contracts-node 2023-09-26 07:58:28.885 INFO main sc_cli::runner: Substrate Contracts Node 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: ✌️ version 0.30.0-124c159ba94 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: ❤️ by Parity Technologies <admin@parity.io>, 2021-2023 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: 📋 Chain specification: Development 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: 🏷 Node name: chilly-desire-6458 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: 👤 Role: AUTHORITY 2023-09-26 07:58:28.887 INFO main sc_cli::runner: 💾 Database: ParityDb at /tmp/substrateoKCAts/chains/dev/paritydb/full 2023-09-26 07:58:38.723 INFO main sc_rpc_server: Running JSON-RPC server: addr=127.0.0.1:9944, allowed origins=[\"*\"] Note that the node is running on port 9944. Next, we'll create some state and produce a bunch of blocks. You can do this by deploying our flipper example: cd ink-examples/flipper/ cargo contract build --release cargo contract instantiate --suri //Alice --args true -x You can check that the contract exists by querying its state via cargo-contract: $ cargo contract storage --contract 5FgRdaReCLFtwbzYiVd2hoz9P3oERdNy2njnFmUBHu4FYg7s +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ | Index | Root Key | Parent | Value | +=====================================================+ | 0 | 00000000 | root | Flipper { value: true } | +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ Setup Chopsticks​ We will now set up Chopsticks, a powerful tool in our ecosystem that allows us to create a parallel reality of an existing network. We will run it and have it mirror the substrate-contracts-node that is already running on our machine from the previous step. The following schema illustrates the setup that we will create: Clone chopsticks: git clone https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks Modify the dev.yml config file in the cloned repository (or create one from scratch) : endpoint: ws://127.0.0.1:9944 mock-signature-host: true block: 1 db: ./db.sqlite info In the example above chopsticks will be mirroring up until block 1 from the substrate-contracts-node. For production chains (like Aleph Zero or Astar) you would want to use a different block number and different endpoint. The Chopsticks repository already contains a wide number of configurations for ink! production chains (see here). If you don't find a fitting configuration there, see the section \"Application to Production Chains\". You can either run chopsticks locally by following the instructions here, or you can run it using npx: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest --config=configs/dev.yml You should get output similar to: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest --config=configs/dev.yml [08:22:31.231] INFO (rpc/3037748): Development RPC listening on port 8000 The Chopsticks node is running on port 8000.

E2E Tests​ Recap: We have our \"live\" substrate-contracts-node running on port 9944 and our test node with the branched state running on port 8000. Next we would like to run some tests against the contract on our forked chain. Our flipper/lib.rs contains a test that illustrates how to do this. The test reads an environment variable CONTRACT_ADDR_HEX that refers to the flipper on-chain address. Here's the code for it: #[ink_e2e::test] #[ignore] async fn e2e_test_deployed_contract<Client: E2EBackend>( mut client: Client, ) -> E2EResult<()> { // given let addr = std::env::var(\"CONTRACT_ADDR_HEX\") .unwrap() .replace(\"0x\", \"\"); let acc_id = hex::decode(addr).unwrap(); let acc_id = AccountId::try_from(&acc_id[..]).unwrap(); // when // Invoke `Flipper::flip()` from Bob's account let call_builder = ink_e2e::create_call_builder::<Flipper>(acc_id); let flip = call_builder.flip(); let _flip_res = client.call(&ink_e2e::bob(), &flip).submit().await?; // then let get = call_builder.get(); let get_res = client.call(&ink_e2e::bob(), &get).dry_run().await?; assert!(matches!(get_res.return_value(), false)); Ok(()) } The test is marked as #[ignore], as it requires the pre-conditions that we went through above to succeed. info You can convert SS58 addresses to hex using the subkey tool: subkey inspect <YOUR-SS58> Here's the process to execute the above test: # Address of your on-chain contract export CONTRACT_HEX=0x2c75f0aa09dbfbfd49e6286a0f2edd3b4913f04a58b13391c79e96782f5713e3 # This env variable needs to be set to reference the Chopsticks node. # If this env variable is not set, `ink_e2e` will spawn a new node # process (typically of `substrate-contracts-node`) for each test. export CONTRACTS_NODE_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8000 cargo test --features e2e-tests e2e_test_deployed_contract -- --ignored You will get output similar to the following: running 1 tests test flipper::e2e_tests::e2e_test_deployed_contract ... ok If you query the contract storage on our Chopsticks fork, you'll see that the E2E test flipped the boolean: $ cargo contract storage --contract 5FgRdaReCLFtwbzYiVd2hoz9P3oERdNy2njnFmUBHu4FYg7s --url=ws://localhost:8000 +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ | Index | Root Key | Parent | Value | +=====================================================+ | 0 | 00000000 | root | Flipper { value: false } | +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ On the \"original\" substrate-contracts-node chain the boolean will be untouched. $ cargo contract storage --contract 5FgRdaReCLFtwbzYiVd2hoz9P3oERdNy2njnFmUBHu4FYg7s --url=ws://localhost:9944 +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ | Index | Root Key | Parent | Value | +=====================================================+ | 0 | 00000000 | root | Flipper { value: true } | +-------+----------+--------+-------------------------+ Success!

There are a few approaches to performing these cross-contract calls in ink!: Contract references (i.e ContractRef) Builders (i.e CreateBuilder and CallBuilder) Contract references can only be used for cross-contract calls to other ink! contracts. Builders can be used to issue cross-contract calls to any Wasm contract, such as those written in ink!, Solang, or ask!. Contract References​ Contract references refer to structs that are generated by the ink! code generation for the purposes of cross-contract calls. They give developers a type-safe way of interacting with a contract. A downside to using them is that you need to import the contract you want to call as a dependency of your own contract. If you want to interact with a contract that is already on-chain you will need to use the Builders approach instead. BasicContractRef walkthrough​ We will walk through the basic_contract_ref example in order to demonstrate how cross-contract calls using contract references work. The general workflow will be: Prepare OtherContract to be imported to other contracts Import OtherContract into BasicContractRef Upload OtherContract on-chain Instantiate OtherContract using BasicContractRef Call OtherContract using BasicContractRef Prepping OtherContract​ We need to make sure that the ink! generated contract ref for OtherContract is available to other pieces of code. We do this by re-exporting the contract reference as follows: pub use self::other_contract::OtherContractRef; Importing OtherContract​ Next, we need to import OtherContract to our BasicContractRef contract. First, we add the following lines to our Cargo.toml file: # In `basic_contract_ref/Cargo.toml` other_contract = { path = \"other_contract\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] } # -- snip -- [features] default = [\"std\"] std = [ \"ink/std\", # -- snip -- \"other_contract/std\", ] Two things to note here: If we don't specify the ink-as-dependency feature we will end up with linking errors. If we don't enable the std feature for std builds we will not be able to generate our contract's metadata. Wiring BasicContractRef​ First, we will import the contract reference of OtherContract, and declare the reference to be part of our storage struct. // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` use other_contract::OtherContractRef; #[ink(storage)] pub struct BasicContractRef { other_contract: OtherContractRef, } Next, we to add a way to instantiate OtherContract. We do this from the constructor of our of contract. // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(other_contract_code_hash: Hash) -> Self { let other_contract = OtherContractRef::new(true) .code_hash(other_contract_code_hash) .endowment(0) .salt_bytes([0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF]) .instantiate(); Self { other_contract } } Note that for instantiating a contract we need access to the uploaded on-chain code_hash. We will get back to this later. Once we have an instantiated reference to OtherContract we can call its messages just like normal Rust methods! // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` #[ink(message)] pub fn flip_and_get(&mut self) -> bool { self.other_contract.flip(); self.other_contract.get() } Uploading OtherContract​ You will need the substrate-contracts-node running in the background for the next steps. We can upload OtherContract using cargo-contract as follows: # In the `basic_contract_ref` directory cargo contract build --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml cargo contract upload --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml --suri //Alice If successful, this will output in a code_hash similar to: Code hash \"0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa\" We can then use this code_hash to instantiate our BasicContractRef contract. Instantiating OtherContract through BasicContractRef​ We will first need to instantiate BasicContractRef. # In the `basic_contract_ref` directory cargo contract build cargo contract instantiate \\ --constructor new \\ --args 0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa \\ --suri //Alice --salt $(date +%s) If successful, this will output in a contract address for BasicContractRef similar to: Contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq Calling with OtherContract through BasicContractRef​ Finally, we can call the OtherContract methods through BasicContractRef as follows: cargo contract call --contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq \\ --message flip_and_get --suri //Alice --dry-run Which will result in something like: Result Success! Reverted false Data Ok(true) Builders​ The CreateBuilder and CallBuilder offer low-level, flexible interfaces for performing cross-contract calls. The CreateBuilder allows you to instantiate already uploaded contracts, and the CallBuilder allows you to call messages on instantiated contracts. CreateBuilder​ The CreateBuilder offers an an easy way for you to instantiate a contract. Note that you'll still need this contract to have been previously uploaded. note For a refresher on the difference between upload and instantiate see here. In order to instantiate a contract you need a reference to your contract, just like in the previous section. Below is an example of how to instantiate a contract using the CreateBuilder. We will: instantiate the uploaded contract with a code_hash of 0x4242... with no gas limit specified (0 means unlimited) sending 10 units of transferred value to the contract instance instantiating with the new constructor with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 generate the address (AccountId) using the specified salt_bytes and we expect it to return a value of type MyContractRef use contract::MyContractRef; let my_contract: MyContractRef = build_create::<MyContractRef>() .code_hash(Hash::from([0x42; 32])) .gas_limit(0) .endowment(10) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"new\"))) .push_arg(42) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .salt_bytes(&[0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF]) .returns::<MyContractRef>() .instantiate(); Since CreateBuilder::instantiate() returns a contract reference, we can use this contract reference to call messages just like in the previous section. CallBuilder​ The CallBuilder gives you a couple of ways to call messages from other contracts. There are two main approaches to this: Calls and DelegateCalls. We will briefly cover both here. CallBuilder: Call​ When using Calls the CallBuilder requires an already instantiated contract. We saw an example of how to use the CreateBuilder to instantiate contracts in the previous section. Below is an example of how to call a contract using the CallBuilder. We will: make a regular Call to a contract at the address 0x4242... with no gas limit specified (0 means unlimited) sending 10 units of transferred value to the contract instance calling the flip message with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 and we expect it to return a value of type bool let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .call(AccountId::from([0x42; 32])) .gas_limit(0) .transferred_value(10) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"flip\"))) .push_arg(42u8) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .returns::<bool>() .invoke(); Note: Message arguments will be encoded in the order in which they are provided to the CallBuilder. This means that they should match the order (and type) they appear in the function signature. You will not be able to get any feedback about this at compile time. You will only find out your call failed at runtime! CallBuilder: Delegate Call​ You can also use the CallBuilder to craft calls using DelegateCall mechanics. If you need a refresher on what delegate calls are, see this article. In the case of DelegateCalls, we don't require an already instantiated contract. We only need the code_hash of an uploaded contract. Below is an example of how to delegate call a contract using the CallBuilder. We will: make a DelegateCall to a contract with a code_hash (not contract address!) of 0x4242... calling the flip message with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 and we expect it to return an i32 let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(ink::primitives::Hash::from([0x42; 32])) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"flip\"))) .push_arg(42u8) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .returns::<i32>() .invoke(); Builder Error Handling​ The CreateBuilder and the CallBuilder both offer error handling with the try_instantiate() and try_invoke() methods respectively. These allow contract developers to handle two types of errors: Errors from the underlying execution environment (e.g the Contracts pallet) Error from the programming language (e.g LangErrors) See the documentation for try_instantiate, try_invoke, ink::env::Error and ink::LangError for more details on proper error handling. tip Because the CallBuilder requires only a contract's AccountId and message selector, we can call Solidity contracts compiled using the Solang compiler and deployed to a chain that supports the pallet-contracts. See here for an example of how to do that. The reverse, calls from Solidity to ink!, are not supported by Solang, but there are plans to implement this in the future.

It is through self that you gain access to all your contract functions and storage items. If you are simply reading from the contract storage, you only need to pass &self. But if you want to modify storage items, you will need to explicitly mark it as mutable, &mut self. impl MyContract { #[ink(message)] pub fn my_getter(&self) -> u32 { self.my_number } #[ink(message)] pub fn my_setter(&mut self, new_value: u32) { self.my_number = new_value; } } Edit this page Previous Reading Values from Storage Next Events Mutable and Immutable Functions","s":"Mutating Storage Values","u":"/5.x/basics/mutating-values","h":"","p":399},{"i":402,"t":"Basics Reading Values from Storage Version: 5.0-rc On this page Reading Values from Storage Reading from storage is where the fun begins!

As a stylistic choice, we recommend breaking up your implementation definitions for your private and public functions: impl MyContract { /// Public function #[ink(message)] pub fn my_public_function(&self) { /* --snip-- */ } /// Private function fn my_private_function(&self) { /* --snip-- */ } /* --snip-- */ } You can also choose to split things up however is most clear for your project.

They are four-byte hexadecimal strings which look something like: 0x633aa551. You can find the selector of an ink! constructor or message in your contract metadata by looking for the selector field of the dispatchable you're interested in. Here is an example of how you can grab the message name and selector from your contract metadata using jq. cat target/ink/flipper.json | jq '.spec.messages[0] | \"\\(.label): \\(.selector)\"' \"flip: 0x633aa551\" Selector Calculation​ If you do not have access to a contract's metadata, you can also calculate it yourself. The algorithm ink! uses is fairly straightforward: Get just the name of the constructor or message Compute the BLAKE2 hash of the name Take the first four bytes of the hash as the selector Let's walk through a short example of what this looks like in practice. Consider the following message: #[ink(message)] fn frobinate(&mut self, fro: bool, bi: u32, nate: AccountId) -> bool { unimplemented!() } To calculate the selector we: Grab the name of the message, frobinate Compute BLAKE2(\"frobinate\") = 0x8e39d7f22ef4f9f1404fe5200768179a8b4f2b67799082d7b39f6a8ca82da8f1 Grab the first four bytes, 0x8e39d7f2 Selector Calculation: ink! Traits​ These rules change a bit if you define any messages using the [ink::trait_definition] macro.

Consider the following trait: #[ink::trait_definition] pub trait Frobinate { fn frobinate(&mut self, fro: bool, bi: u32, nate: AccountId) -> bool; } -- snip -- impl Frobinate for Contract { #[ink(message)] fn frobinate(&mut self, fro: bool, bi: u32, nate: AccountId) -> bool { unimplemented!() } } To calculate the selector we: Grab the name of the trait and the name of the message, Frobinate::frobinate Compute BLAKE2(\"Frobinate::frobinate\") = 0x8915412ad772b2a116917cf75df4ba461b5808556a73f729bce582fb79200c5b Grab the first four bytes, 0x8915412a tip Don't worry if you're not able to calculate the BLAKE2 hash of a string by hand.

Traits","s":"Selectors","u":"/5.x/basics/selectors","h":"","p":403},{"i":406,"t":"Basics Events Version: 5.0-rc On this page Events An ink! smart contract may define events that it can emit during contract execution. Emitting events can be used by third party tools to query information about a contract's execution and state. Example​ The following example ink! contract shows how an event Transferred is defined and emitted in the #[ink(constructor)]. #[ink::contract] mod erc20 { /// Defines an event that is emitted /// every time value is transferred. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transferred { from: Option<AccountId>, to: Option<AccountId>, value: Balance, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Erc20 { total_supply: Balance, // more fields ... } impl Erc20 { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), value: initial_supply, }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply } } #[ink(message)] pub fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { self.total_supply } } } See our ERC20 example contract for an elaborate example which uses events. Event Definition​ Since ink! version 5.0, events can be defined independently of the contract which emits them. Events can now be defined once and shared across multiple contracts. This is useful for events for contracts which conform to standards such as ERC-20: contract indexers/explorers are now able to group all e.g. Transferred events. This is how an event definition looks: use ink::primitives::AccountId; #[ink::event] pub struct Transferred { #[ink(topic)] from: Option<AccountId>, #[ink(topic)] to: Option<AccountId>, amount: u128, } Note that generics are not currently supported , so the concrete types of Environment specific types such as AccountId must match up with the types used in the contract. This definition can exist within a contract definition module (inline events), in a different module in the same crate or even in a different crate to be shared by multiple contracts. Legacy syntax for inline Event definitions​ Events defined within a #[ink::contract] module can continue to use the original syntax for an event definition, using the #[ink(event)] attribute. Under the covers this is simply expanded to the new top level #[ink::event] macro, so both events defined using the legacy style and using the new event attribute macro directly will behave exactly the same. Topics​ When an event is emitted, 0 or more topics can be associated with it. The event is then indexed together with other events with the same topic value. An event's fields can be annotated with #[ink(topic)] (see example), which will result in a topic derived from the value of that field being emitted together with the event. Topics are by default a 32 byte array ([u8; 32]), although this is configurable on the Polkadot SDK runtime level. If the SCALE encoded bytes of a field value are <= 32, then the encoded bytes are used directly as the topic value. For example, in the common case of indexing a field of type AccountId, where the default AccountId type is 32 bytes in length, the topic value will be the encoded account id itself. This makes it easy to filter for all events which have a topic of a specific AccountId. If however the size of the encoded bytes of the value of a field exceeds 32, then the encoded bytes will be hashed using the Blake2x256 hasher. Topics are a native concept in the Polkadot SDK, and can be queried via EventTopics How to choose which fields to make topics? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself if somebody might want to search for this topic. For this reason the amount in the example Transferred event above was not made indexable ‒ there will most probably be a lot of different events with differing amounts each. Signature Topic​ By default all events have a signature topic. This allows indexing of all events of the same type, emitted by different contracts. The #[ink::event] macro generates a signature topic at compile time by hashing the name of the event concatenated with the names of the types of the all the field names: blake2b(\"Event(field1_type,field2_type)\")` So for our Transferred example it will be: blake2b(\"Transferred(Option<AccountId>,Option<AccountId>,u128)\")` caution Important caveat: because the name of the field type is used, refactoring an event definition to use a type alias or a fully qualified type will change the signature topic, even though the underlying type is the same. Two otherwise identical definitions of an event with the same name and same field types but different field type names will have different signature topics. When decoding events emitted from a contract, signature topics are now required to determine which type of event to decode into. Anonymous Events​ Annotating an event definition with #[ink(anonymous)] (See here for details on this attribute) prevents a signature topic from being generated and published with the event. It means that an indexer will not be able to index over the type of the event, which may be desirable for some contracts, and would be a small gas cost optimization if necessary. However, when interacting with the contract from a client, no signature topic means that another way is required to determine the type of the event to be decoded into (i.e. how do we know it is a Transferred event, not an Approval event. One way would be to try decoding for each type of event defined in the metadata of the contract until one succeeds. If calling a specific message, it may be known up front what type of event that message will raise, so the client code could just decode into that event directly. Emitting Events in a Constructor​ In a constructor events are emitted via Self::env().emit_event(). See this example: #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); let mut balances = HashMap::new(); balances.insert(caller, initial_supply); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), amount: initial_supply }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply, balances } } Emitting Events from Messages​ In a message events are emitted via self.env().emit_event(): #[ink(message)] pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance) -> Result { let from = self.env().caller(); // implementation hidden self.env().emit_event(Transferred { from: Some(from), to: Some(to), amount }); Ok(()) } Cost of using Events​ When using events and topics, developers should be mindful of the costs associated. Firstly: if optimizing for contract size, using events will increase the size of the final code size. So minimizing or eliminating event usage where necessary will reduce contract size. The same can be said for the execution (aka gas) costs when using events. We recommend considering the cost of events when using them, and measuring the code size and gas costs with different usage patterns when optimizing.

Furthermore, ink! provides substrate specific types like AccountId, Balance, and Hash to smart contracts as if they were primitive types. String, Vector and More​ The ink_prelude crate provides an efficient approach to import commonly used Rust types such as String and Vec, ensuring safe usage within an ink! contract. This simplifies the type referencing process between the std and no_std environments. Typically, these types are defined within the std crate in the std environment, and the alloc crate in the no_std environment. Given that ink! smart contract code is compiled in both environments (no_std for production and std for unit tests), developers might find themselves writing intricate conditional compilation macros. The ink_prelude crate conveniently re-exports these types, eliminating this complexity. You can use the prelude definitions like this: #[ink::contract] mod MyContractWithStringsAndArrays { use ink::prelude::string::String; use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store some String my_string: String, // Store some u32 in a vec my_vector: Vec<u32>, } /* --snip-- */ } Mapping​ ink! also provides a Mapping storage type. You can read more about it here. Substrate Types​ Here is an example of how you would store substrate types AccountId, Balance and Hash: #[ink::contract] mod MyContract { // Our struct will use those default ink! types #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store some AccountId my_account: AccountId, // Store some Balance my_balance: Balance, // Store some Hash my_hash: Hash, } /* --snip-- */ } Enum​ Enum can be used as a datatype as well. It's use in the example in the Struct section. pub enum Status { /// An auction has not started yet. NotStarted, /// We are in the starting period of the auction, collecting initial bids. OpeningPeriod, /// We are in the ending period of the auction, where we are taking snapshots /// of the winning bids. } Struct​ You can even combine all the above mentioned types in a custom struct which you can then store in the contract's storage. mod MyContract { use ink::prelude::string::String; use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; pub struct Auction { /// Branded name of the auction event. name: String, /// Some hash identifying the auction subject. subject: Hash, /// Auction status. status: Status, // Enum: Usage shown in next section /// Candle auction can have no winner. /// If auction is finalized, that means that the winner is determined. finalized: bool, /// vector vector: Vec<u8>, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store Auctions in a vec auctions: Vec<Auction>, } } The values of an enum should be referenced as Status::OpeningPeriod. Initializing Storage in Constructors​ Constructors are how values get initialized. Every ink! smart contract must have a constructor which is run once when a contract is created. ink! smart contracts can have multiple constructors: Note that if you have a contract whose storage contains Mapping's you will need to use ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract in your constructor. See the Mapping documentation for more details. #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { number: u32, } impl MyContract { /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the given `init_value`. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self { Self { number: init_value, } } /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the `u32` default. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn default() -> Self { Self { number: Default::default(), } } /* --snip-- */ } } Edit this page Previous Contract Template Next Reading Values from Storage Supported Types String, Vector and More Mapping Substrate Types Enum Struct Initializing Storage in Constructors","s":"Storing Values","u":"/5.x/basics/storing-values","h":"","p":407},{"i":410,"t":"Basics Metadata Version: 5.0-rc On this page ink! Metadata The ink! metadata is used to describe a contract in a language agnostic way. It is intended to be used by third party tools (e.g. UIs, block explorers) in order to correctly call contract functions and interpret events. The ink! metadata is generated when a contract is built using cargo-contract, e.g cargo contract build. The metadata can be found in your contract's target directory under the name <contract-name>.json. note The metadata is also contained in your <contract-name>.contract file. The difference is that the .contract file also contains the Wasm binary of your contract. <contract-name>.json​ The metadata is defined by the following required keys: source: Information about the contract's Wasm code. contract: Metadata about the contract. abi: Raw JSON of the contract's abi metadata, generated during contract compilation. It may optionally contain the following keys: user: Additional user-defined metadata. { \"source\": { \"hash\": \"...\", \"language\": \"...\", \"compiler\": \"...\" }, \"contract\": { \"name\": \"...\", \"version\": \"...\", \"authors\": [ \"...\" ] }, \"spec\": { \"constructors\": [\"...\"], \"messages\": [\"...\"] } } note Notice that we don't have an abi key, but we instead use the spec field to specify the contract's ABI. You can read more about that in the ABI documentation. The following sections will dive deeper into how these sections are made up. source​ This object contains information about how the contract was built. It consists of the following required keys: hash: The hash of the contract's Wasm code. language: The language used to write the contract. compiler: The compiler used to compile the contract. It may optionally include the following keys: wasm: The actual Wasm code of the contract, for optionally bundling the code with the metadata. build_info: Extra information about the environment in which the contract was built. \"source\": { \"hash\": \"0x157014494527fee27a82e49bbd9eea10c0713bb0566f6def37f4595db86236ff\", \"language\": \"ink! 4.0.0\", \"compiler\": \"rustc 1.66.0\" } info If you're interested in the code reference from cargo-contract see here. contract​ This object contains extra metadata about the contract.

ABI​ This is the specification of the contract. Unlike the previous metadata sections the structure of the object stored here is not defined. Instead, it is up to each programming language (e.g. ink!, ask!, Solidity) to define their own metadata format which will then be stored here. In this document we will focus on the ink! ABI. The ink! metadata consists of the following required sections spec: The description of the contract (e.g constructors, messages, events, etc.). storage: The layout of the storage data structure types: A read-only registry containing types in their portable form for serialization. version: The version of the ink! metadata. \"spec\": { ... }, \"storage\": { ... }, \"types\": { ... }, \"version\": \"...\" info If you're interested in the code reference from ink! see here. spec​ The contract spec consists of the following required keys: constructors: The set of constructors of the contract. label: The label of the constructor.

In case of trait provided messages and constructors the prefix by convention in ink! is the label of the trait. selector: The selector hash of the message. mutates: If the message is allowed to mutate the contract state. payable: If the message accepts any value from the caller. default: If the message is marked as default, useful for UIs. args: The parameters of the message. return_type: The return type of the message. docs: The message documentation. environment: Configuration of the types that the host blockchain operates with. You can check default types in Environment section. accountId: The type describing an account address. balance: The type describing balance values. blockNumber: The type describing a block number. chainExtension: The type describing the chain extension for the environment. For more information about usage and definition check this section. maxEventTopics: The maximum number of supported event topics provided by the runtime. timestamp: the type describing a timestamp. events: The events of the contract. label: The label of the event. args: The event arguments. docs: The event documentation. docs: The contract documentation. lang_error: The language specific error type. note While all these keys are required, they may be empty. For example, if a contract does not define any events then the events key would contain an empty array []. ink! 3.x Compatibility Note The lang_error field was introduced as part of ink! 4.0. This represents an error which comes from the smart contracting language itself, and not the contract nor the underlying environment (e.g pallet-contracts). All ink! messages and constructors now return a Result which uses this as the Error variant (see the LangError docs for more). \"spec\": { \"constructors\": [ { \"args\": [ { ... } ], \"docs\": [ \"Creates a new flipper smart contract initialized with the given value.\" ], \"label\": \"new\", \"payable\": false, \"default\": false, \"selector\": \"0x9bae9d5e\" } ], \"docs\": [], \"events\": [], \"lang_error\": { \"displayName\": [ \"ink\", \"LangError\" ], \"type\": 3 }, \"messages\": [ { \"args\": [], \"docs\": [ \" Flips the current value of the Flipper's boolean.\" ], \"label\": \"flip\", \"mutates\": true, \"payable\": false, \"default\": false, \"returnType\": null, \"selector\": \"0x633aa551\" } ] } storage​ This key describes the storage layout of an ink! contract.

It consists of an array of type objects, each of which is defined as follows: id: Numerical ID for referencing the type. ty: The definition of the type. path: The unique path to the type. Can be empty for built-in types. params: The generic type parameters of the type in use. Empty for non generic types. def: The actual type definition. docs: Documentation. The type definition object (def) supports the following primitive types: bool, char, str, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128. It also supports a variety of complex built-in and user-defined types. However, we will not dig into them here. If you are interested in learning more take a look at the scale-info crate. \"types\": [ { \"id\": 0, \"type\": { \"def\": { \"primitive\": \"bool\" } } } ] Other parts of the metadata, such as the storage object, will reference individual types from this type registry using the id key. version​ This indicates the version of the ABI format the generated metadata conforms to. This is distinct from any concept of Rust's crate versioning. \"version\": \"4\" ink! 3.x Compatibility Note In version 3 of the ink! metadata the version was specified as a key which wrapped the ABI (e.g \"V3\": { ... }). This is no longer the case with version 4. user​ This is an optional field used to add user-defined metadata.

The verification process for Rust-based smart contract languages is more complex than EVM-based languages such as Solidity due to the Rust compiler not providing deterministic builds of contracts. In order to verify an ink! smart contract, the verification process must recompile the contract in an identical host environment to which it was originally built. The simplest way to do this is using a Docker container. Since ink! 4.0, cargo-contract provides the necessary tools to produce a verifiable build and verify a binary against the reference contract. note Contract verification tools are available from cargo-contract version 4.0 on. To install it, run cargo install cargo-contract --locked --version ^4 Verifiable build​ As mentioned earlier, due to the non-deterministic nature of Rust compilation, smart contract developers are advised to build their project inside a Docker container we provide. Luckily, cargo contract build provides the --verifiable flag for this purpose. The steps for the verifiable build production are: Install Docker Engine (Linux users) Make sure you complete the post-installation step. This is required for the correct operation of the command. Ensure Docker Engine is up and running, and the socket is accessible. Simply run cargo contract build --verifiable. This will pull the image with the version that corresponds to your cargo-contract crate version, perform a build, and write artifacts in the standard output directory. If everything is correct, you can verify the image version in the metadata file. It should contain a key-value image after the contract information: \"contract\": { \"name\": \"flipper\", \"version\": \"4.3.0\", \"authors\": [ \"Parity Technologies <admin@parity.io>\" ] }, \"image\": \"paritytech/contracts-verifiable:4.0.0-alpha\", You are now ready to deploy your contract to a production chain. note The image is amd64 based. Therefore, the build times can be significantly slower on Apple Silicon machines. To overcome the issue enable Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation in Settings → Features in development tab in Docker Desktop App. Verifying contract​ Similarly to etherscan, you want to ensure that the given contract bundle is indeed a copy of some well-known contract code. There are two options when it comes to verification: Local bare-bones verification using cargo contract verify A third-party service Sirato cargo contract verify allows you to verify the given cargo project against a reference contract bundle. Simply run cargo contract verify <path> in the cargo project directory. If the reference contract was not build inside a docker container, the command will compare the build info from the reference contract with the current environment to ensure a match in environment. warning If you are not using standardized verifiable builds. It is your responsibility to ensure deterministic environment both for build and verification of smart contracts. If the build info from the .contract file matches the environment and a docker image is present in metadata, cargo contract will build the project inside the specified image docker container. Otherwise, a local build is carried out. Upon completion, the built contract bundle is compared to the reference one and the result is returned. Advanced usage​ If you would like to carry out other operations inside a deterministic environment you can use our docker image. It is availble on Docker Hub. The entry point is set to cargo contract allowing you to specify other commands to be executed. tip If you are building a multi-contract project, make sure you are executing the build in the parent directory in order to mount the directory of all contracts to be visible.

This can be used alongside the verifiable build image container to verify ink! smart contracts. The following steps outline how to create a verifiable build and subsequently verify it using these services. Performing a verifiable build​ You should already be familiar with using cargo-contract to compile your contract. You will need to install the ink! verified image crate: cargo install — git https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image.git You can now perform a verified build by running the following command in the smart contracts project folder: build-verifiable-ink -i ghcr.io/web3labs/ink-verifier . note Reproducable builds only work with cargo-contract >= 2.0.2 and contracts generated with that version onwards. To work around this you can use the signed metadata file instead. If you were to use the flipper example you would see output similar to the below: ... [5/5] Generating bundle Original wasm size: 20.6K, Optimized: 1.4K The contract was built in RELEASE mode. Your contract artifacts are ready. You can find them in: /build/package/src/target/ink - flipper.contract (code + metadata) - flipper.wasm (the contract's code) - flipper.json (the contract's metadata) adding: src/ (stored 0%) adding: src/Cargo.lock (deflated 75%) adding: src/Cargo.toml (deflated 52%) adding: src/lib.rs (deflated 72%) adding: flipper.contract (deflated 64%) Verification package in /build/target/ink/package.zip Archive: /build/target/ink/package.zip Length Date Time Name --------- ---------- ----- ---- 0 2023-03-08 21:41 src/ 105695 2023-03-08 21:28 src/Cargo.lock 573 2023-03-08 20:40 src/Cargo.toml 5177 2023-03-08 20:40 src/lib.rs 5278 2023-03-08 21:41 flipper.contract --------- ------- 116723 5 files If you have any issues running the build, you can built it yourself by running the following commands: cd ../ git clone https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image.git cd ink-verifier-image docker build . -t ink-verifier:develop cd ../flipper build-verifiable-ink -t develop . There will now be a package zipfile available which contains the contract source code, metadata and Wasm binary: tree -L 3 . ├── Cargo.lock ├── Cargo.toml ├── lib.rs └── target └── ink └── package.zip Now that you have created the verified build, you can deploy your contract. Once deployed, you will need to make a note of the contract's code hash in order to verify it. Verifying an ink! smart contract​ Using the verification service web app​ The ink! Verification Service is a RESTful web service created for verifying smart contracts deployed using pallet-contracts. Web3 Labs host a public instance of the service at ink-verifier.sirato.xyz. A Swagger interface to the service is also avilable at ink-verifier.sirato.xyz/api/api-docs/. The verification process entails the following steps: A requestor uploads the source packge archive for a network and code hash The server checks that: The source code for the network and code hash is not already verified or being verified There is enough host resources to start a new verification The server downloads the pristine Wasm byte code correspondening to the provided network and code hash The server streams the archive if it is a compressed archive The server moves the staging files to the processing directory The server runs a container process for the verifier image to verify the package in processing. See source code verification workflow for details On the event of container exit the server moves the verified artificats to the publish directory if the verification was successful, otherwise keeps a log in the errors directory It works with any network that is defined in the @polkadot/apps-config package. In order to verify a deployed contract using the service you will need to use the /verify/{network}/{codeHash} endpoint which is documented here. Once a contract has been verified you can use the /contract/{codeHash}/metadata.json and /contract/{codeHash}/src endpoints to retrieve metadata and source code respectively. Using Sirato​ Sirato Substrate is a smart contract explorer for ink! smart contracts. It integrates with the contract verification service allowing users to upload package files generated by the verifiable build image via the Sirato UI instead of having to use the web endpoint. In addition once a contract has been verified, details of any contract activity and events taking place on a parachain or Substrate chain are decoded for the user in Sirato. For instance, in order to verify a contract deployed on the Rococo parachain, you can head to the Sirato instance at substrate.sirato.xyz. From there you can navigate to the deployed code by clicking on the Code reference that matches the code hash returned by the cargo contract instantiate call. Alternatively, you can navigate directly by entering the URL https://substrate.sirato.xyz/codes/0x<code-hash>. Now click on the source code tab: Then upload the verified package.zip file that you generated earlier. You can now start the verification process which kicks off a build of the provided resources. Once the process has finished you will see the message Contract successfully verified. Clicking Browse verified files will display the associated metadata and source files for your contract. If we then browse back to our contract instance, any methods or events will now be decoded. We can verify this by invoking a method on the contract. We can now see the decoded method that was called in Sirato. Unverified metadata upload​ The verification service supports uploading signed contract metadata as an additional alternative to reproducible builds generated metadata. Please note that the signed metadata is not verified and the owner of the code hash is trusted. This feature responds to: The support for build_info data is only available from cargo-contract 2.0.2. There is no official image or procedure regarding reproducible builds yet. We want to expand the service utility in the meantime. Although it is a far from ideal way to bind the metadata to a given code hash it prevents trivial exploitation by: Verifying that the signature is from the owner account of the code hash. Verifying that the signed message matches the sha256 of the uploaded metadata.json + the code hash of the uploaded contract bytecode. To provide signed metadata, you will need to use the /upload/{network}/{codeHash} endpoint which is documented here For the request body you will need to sign this message using the account that uploaded the contract. You can use the sign and verify tool in Polkadot.js. It is also possible to use Sirato for this, you can find instructions here.

However, contract authors should know that they can also create their own custom data structures. Using custom types on storage​ Any custom type wanting to be compatible with ink! storage must implement the Storable trait, so it can be SCALE encoded and decoded. Additionally, the traits StorageLayout and TypeInfo are required as well. But don't worry, usually these traits can just be derived: /// A custom type that we can use in our contract storage #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] #[cfg_attr( feature = \"std\", derive(ink::storage::traits::StorageLayout) )] pub struct Inner { value: bool, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct ContractStorage { inner: Inner, } Even better: there is a macro #[ink::storage_item], which derives all necessary traits for you. If there is no need to implement any special behavior, the above code example can be simplified further as follows: /// A custom type that we can use in our contract storage #[ink::storage_item] pub struct Inner { value: bool, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct ContractStorage { inner: Inner, } Naturally, you can as well implement any required trait manually. Please directly refer to the relevant trait documentations for more information. note The #[ink::storage_item] macro is responsible for storage key calculation of non-Packed types. Without it, the key for non-Packed fields will be zero. Using this macro is necessary if you don't plan to use a ManualKey on a non-Packed type. Types with custom implementations of the ink! storage traits can still use this macro only for key calculation by disabling the derives: #[ink::storage_item(derive = false)]. Generic storage fields​ It is possible to use generic data types in your storage, as long as any generic type satisfies the required storage trait bounds. In fact, we already witnessed this in the previous sections about the Mapping. Let's say you want a mapping where accessing a non-existent key should just return it's default value, akin to how mappings work in Solidity. Additionally, you want to know how many values there are in the mapping (its length). This could be implemented as a thin wrapper around the ink! Mapping as follows: /// Values for this map need to implement the `Default` trait. /// Naturally, they also must be compatible with contract storage. /// Note that the underlying `Mapping` type only supports `Packed` values. #[ink::storage_item] pub struct DefaultMap<K, V: Packed + Default> { values: Mapping<K, V>, length: u32, } impl<K: Encode, V: Packed + Default> DefaultMap<K, V> { /// Accessing non-existent keys will return the default value. pub fn get(&self, key: &K) -> V { self.values.get(key).unwrap_or_default() } /// Inserting into the map increases its length by one. pub fn set<I, U>(&mut self, key: I, value: &U) where I: scale::EncodeLike<K>, E: scale::EncodeLike<V> + Storable, { if self.values.insert(key, value).is_none() { self.length += 1 } } /// Removing a value from the map decreases its length by one. pub fn remove(&mut self, key: &K) { if self.values.take(key).is_some() { self.length -= 1 } } /// Return how many values the mapping contains pub fn len(&self) -> u32 { self.length } } /// `DefaultMap` is compatible with contract storage. #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { my_map: DefaultMap<BlockNumber, Balance>, } caution Generic data types may substantially increase your contracts overall code size, making it more costly to store on-chain.

The developer may need to fix a critical bug or introduce a new feature. For this type of scenario, ink! has different upgrade strategies. Upgradeable Contracts Proxy Forwarding Properties Example Delegating execution to foreign Contract Code with delegate_call Properties Example Note on the usage of wildcard selectors Note on CallFlags Replacing Contract Code with set_code_hash() Properties Example Storage Compatibility A little note on the determinism of contract addresses Examples Proxy Forwarding​ This method relies on the ability of contracts to proxy calls to other contracts. Properties​ Forwards any call that does not match a selector of itself to another contract. The other contract needs to be deployed on-chain. State is stored in the storage of the contract to which calls are forwarded. User ---- tx ---> Proxy ----------> Implementation_v0 | ------------> Implementation_v1 | ------------> Implementation_v2 Example​ Our proxy contract will have these 2 storage fields: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Proxy { /// The `AccountId` of a contract where any call that does not match a /// selector of this contract is forwarded to. forward_to: AccountId, /// The `AccountId` of a privileged account that can update the /// forwarding address. This address is set to the account that /// instantiated this contract. admin: AccountId, } We then need a way to change the address of a contract to which we forward calls to and the actual message selector to proxy the call: impl Proxy { /// Changes the `AccountId` of the contract where any call that does /// not match a selector of this contract is forwarded to. /// /// # Note /// Only one extra message with a well-known selector `@` is allowed. #[ink(message, selector = @)] pub fn change_forward_address(&mut self, new_address: AccountId) { assert_eq!( self.env().caller(), self.admin, \"caller {:?} does not have sufficient permissions, only {:?} does\", self.env().caller(), self.admin, ); self.forward_to = new_address; } /// Fallback message for a contract call that doesn't match any /// of the other message selectors. /// /// # Note: /// /// - We allow payable messages here and would forward any optionally supplied /// value as well. /// - If the self receiver were `forward(&mut self)` here, this would not /// have any effect whatsoever on the contract we forward to. #[ink(message, payable, selector = _)] pub fn forward(&self) -> u32 { ink::env::call::build_call::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>() .call(self.forward_to) .transferred_value(self.env().transferred_value()) .call_flags( ink::env::CallFlags::default() .set_forward_input(true) .set_tail_call(true), ) .invoke() .unwrap_or_else(|err| { panic!( \"cross-contract call to {:?} failed due to {:?}\", self.forward_to, err ) }); unreachable!( \"the forwarded call will never return since `tail_call` was set\" ); } } tip Take a look at the selector pattern in the attribute macro: by declaring selector = _ we specify that all other messages should be handled by this message selector. Using this pattern, you can introduce other message to your proxy contract. Any messages that are not matched in the proxy contract will be forwarded to the specified contract address. Delegating execution to foreign Contract Code with delegate_call​ Similar to proxy-forwarding we can delegate execution to another code hash uploaded on-chain. Properties​ Delegates any call that does not match a selector of itself to another contract. Code is required to be uploaded on-chain, but is not required to be instantiated. State is stored in the storage of the original contract which submits the call. Storage layout must be identical between both contract codes. (Storage of Contract A) User ---- tx ---> Contract A ----------> Code_v0 | ^ | | ⌊_____________________⌋ Storage is delegated to Example​ Suppose we have defined of the caller contract as following: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Delegator { addresses: Mapping<AccountId, i32, ManualKey<0x23>>, counter: i32, } Then let's define two messages that separately calls to update addresses and counter separately: /// Increment the current value using delegate call. #[ink(message)] pub fn inc_delegate(&self, hash: Hash) { let selector = ink::selector_bytes!(\"inc\"); let _ = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(hash) // if the receiver is set to `&mut self`, // then any changes made in `inc_delegate()` before the delegate call // will be persisted, and any changes made within delegate call will be discarded. // Therefore, it is advised to use `&self` receiver with a mutating delegate call, // or `.set_tail_call(true)` to flag that any changes made by delegate call should be flushed into storage. // .call_flags(CallFlags::default().set_tail_call(true)) .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(selector))) .returns::<()>() .try_invoke(); } /// Adds entry to `addresses` using delegate call. /// Note that we don't need `set_tail_call(true)` flag /// because `Mapping` updates the storage instantly on-demand. #[ink(message)] pub fn add_entry_delegate(&mut self, hash: Hash) { let selector = ink::selector_bytes!(\"append_address_value\"); let _ = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(hash) .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(selector))) .returns::<()>() .try_invoke(); } ink! provides an intuitive call builder API for you to compose your call. As you can see that inc_delegate() can be built a call in slightly different manner than add_entry_delegate(). That's because if the delegated code modifies layout-full storage (i.e. it contains at least non-Lazy, non-Mapping field), either the receiver should be set to &self or the .set_tail_call(true) flag of CallFlags needs to be specified, and the storage layouts must match. This is due to the way ink! execution call stack is operated. Non-Lazy, non-Mapping field are first loaded into the memory. If &mut self receiver is used, then when delegate call is completed, the original state before the call will be persisted and flushed into the storage. Therefore, .set_tail_call(true) needs to be set to indicate that, that delegate call's storage context is the final (i.e. _tail) one that needs to be flushed. This also makes any code after the delegate call unreachable. With &self receiver, .set_tail_call(true) is not required since no storage flushing happens at the end of the original caller's function. (see Stack Exchange Answer for details on how changes are flushed into storage). Key compatibility If the delegated code modifies Lazy or Mapping field, the keys must be identical and .set_tail_call(true) is optional regardless of the function receiver. This is because Lazy and Mapping interact with the storage directly instead of loading and flushing storage states. Now let's look at the \"delegatee\" code: #[ink::contract] pub mod delegatee { use ink::storage::{ traits::ManualKey, Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] pub struct Delegatee { // `ManualKey` must be the same as in the original contract. addresses: Mapping<AccountId, i32, ManualKey<0x23>>, counter: i32, // Uncommenting below line will break storage compatibility. // flag: bool, } impl Delegatee { /// When using the delegate call. You only upload the code of the delegatee /// contract. However, the code and storage do not get initialized. /// /// Because of this. The constructor actually never gets called. #[allow(clippy::new_without_default)] #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { unreachable!( \"Constructors are not called when upgrading using `set_code_hash`.\" ) } /// Increments the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn inc(&mut self) { self.counter = self.counter.checked_add(2).unwrap(); } /// Adds current value of counter to the `addresses` #[ink(message)] pub fn append_address_value(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); self.addresses.insert(caller, &self.counter); } } } As you can see, delegatee's code looks like a normal ink! Smart Contract with some important features: Storage layout is identical to the original contract's storage addresses mapping key is identical Constructor does not have any logic, as the code is never instantiated. (It can be, but plays no effect on the execution) Note on the usage of wildcard selectors​ When working with cross-contract calls, developers are required to be aware of the some important changes. Since ink! 5 we have restricted the usage of the wildcard selector due to security reasons. Beware Due to IIP-2, ink! only allows to contain a single message with a well-known selector @ when the other message with the wildcard selector _ is defined. See example for illustration on how it can be used in practice. Note on CallFlags​ CallFlags provide fine-grained control over the cross-contract execution. Some useful properties: Re-entry is disable by default. It can be enabled with .set_allow_reentry(true) flag. The call execution context is returned to the caller by default. You can finish execution in the callee with .set_tail_call(true) flag. .set_clone_input(true) clones the input of the caller's messages. It can be used with when .set_tail_call(false). .set_forward_input(true) consumes the input of the caller's message which can be used after. It can be used with when .set_tail_call(true). Replacing Contract Code with set_code_hash()​ Following Substrate's runtime upgradeability philosophy, ink! also supports an easy way to update your contract code via the special function set_code_hash(). Properties​ Updates the contract code using set_code_hash(). This effectively replaces the code which is executed for the contract address. The other contract needs to be deployed on-chain. State is stored in the storage of the originally instantiated contract. Example​ Just add the following function to the contract you want to upgrade in the future. /// Modifies the code which is used to execute calls to this contract address (`AccountId`). /// /// We use this to upgrade the contract logic. We don't do any authorization here, any caller /// can execute this method. In a production contract you would do some authorization here. #[ink(message)] pub fn set_code(&mut self, code_hash: [u8; 32]) { ink::env::set_code_hash(&code_hash).unwrap_or_else(|err| { panic!( \"Failed to `set_code_hash` to {:?} due to {:?}\", code_hash, err ) }); ink::env::debug_println!(\"Switched code hash to {:?}.\", code_hash); } Storage Compatibility​ It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the new contract's storage is compatible with the storage of the contract that is replaced. Beware You should not change the order in which the contract state variables are declared, nor their type! Violating the restriction will not prevent a successful compilation, but will result in the mix-up of values or failure to read the storage correctly. This can be a result of severe errors in the application utilizing the contract. If the storage of your contract looks like this: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u32, y: bool, } The procedures listed below will make it invalid Changing the order of variables: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { y: bool, x: u32, } Removing an existing variable: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u32, } Changing the type of a variable: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u64, y: bool, } Introducing a new variable before any of the existing ones: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { z: Vec<u32>, x: u32, y: bool, } A little note on the determinism of contract addresses​ note If your contract utilizes this approach, it no-longer holds a deterministic address assumption. You can no longer assume that a contract address identifies a specific code hash. Please refer to the issue for more details.

At the moment it provides two primitives for interacting with storage, Mapping and Lazy. Mapping is a mapping of key-value pairs directly to the contract storage. It is very similar to traditional hash tables and comparable to the mapping type Solidity offers. As a core ingredient to the ink! language, its main advantage is being simple and lightweight: It favors being efficient in terms of gas costs and code size over providing a lot of high-level functionality found in other implementations like the ink::prelude::collections::HashMap type. Overall, the ink! Mapping will be solid choice for most contracts. Moreover, smart contracts developers can implement advanced features themselves. Lazy is a wrapper type that can be used over any other storage compatible type. This allows smart contract developers fine-grained manual control over the layout of the contract storage by assigning a separate storage cell for the field. For example, it can be used to prevent the contract from eagerly loading large storage fields during each contract call. Conceivably, it may be desirable to change certain aspects on how your contract deals with its storage variables. You can find out more about this in the section about the ink! Storage Layout. Edit this page Previous #[ink::chain_extension] Next Working with StorageVec","s":"Overview","u":"/5.x/datastructures/overview","h":"","p":431},{"i":434,"t":"Storage & Data Structures Storage Layout Version: 5.0-rc On this page Storage Layout Smart contract authors are given some flexibility in regards on how they want to organize the storage layout of their contracts. Let's dive deeper into the concepts behind ink! storage to get a better understanding of some of its implications and limitations. Storage Organization​ The following schema depicts the storage which is exposed to ink! by the contracts pallet: Storage data is always encoded with the SCALE codec. The storage API operates by storing and loading entries into and from a single storage cells, where each storage cell is accessed under its own dedicated storage key. To some extent, the storage API works similar to a traditional key-value database. Packed vs Non-Packed layout​ Types that can be stored entirely under a single storage cell are considered Packed. By default, ink! tries to store all storage struct fields under a single storage cell. Consequentially, with a Packed storage layout, any message interacting with the contract storage will always need to operate on the entire contract storage struct. For example, if we have a somewhat small contract storage struct consisting of only a few tiny fields, pulling everything from the storage inside every message is not problematic. It may even be advantageous - especially if we expect most messages to interact with most of the storage fields. On the other hand, this can get problematic if we're storing a large ink::prelude::vec::Vec in the contract storage but provide messages that do not need to read and write from this Vec. In that scenario, each and every contract message bears runtime overhead by dealing with that Vec, regardless whether they access it or not. This results in extra gas costs. To solve this problem we need to turn our storage into a non-packed layout somehow. caution If any type exhibiting Packed layout gets large enough (an ever-growing Vec might be a prime candidate for this), it will break your contract. This is because for encoding and decoding storage items, there is a buffer with only limited capacity (around 16KB in the default configuration) available. This means any contract trying to decode more than that will trap! If you are unsure about the potential size a data structure might get, consider using an ink! Mapping, which can store an arbitrary number of elements, instead. Eager Loading vs. Lazy Loading​ ink! provides means of breaking the storage up into smaller pieces, which can be loaded on demand, with the Lazy primitive. Wrapping any storage field inside a Lazy struct makes the storage struct in which that field appears also non-Packed, preventing it from being eagerly loaded during arbitrary storage operations: Note that in above illustration, the key of 0x12345678 just serves as an example; we'll learn more about storage key calculation later in this chapter. The following example demonstrates how we can solve the problem introduced in the above section. You'll notice that for the lazily loaded storage field, we now work with getters and setters to access and modify the underlying storage value: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; use ink::storage::Lazy; #[derive(Default)] #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { tiny_value: Balance, /// This vector might get large and expensive to work with. /// We want to enforce a non-`Packed` storage layout. large_vec: Lazy<Vec<Balance>>, } impl MyContract { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self::default() } /// Because `large_vec` is loaded lazily, this message is always cheap. #[ink(message)] pub fn get_balance(&self) -> Balance { self.tiny_value } /// Lazy fields like `large_vec` provide `get()` and `set()` storage operators. #[ink(message)] pub fn add_balance(&mut self, value: Balance) { let mut balances = self.large_vec.get_or_default(); balances.push(value); self.large_vec.set(&balances); } } } caution ink::prelude::vec::Vec's are always loaded in their entirety. This is because all elements of the ink::prelude::vec::Vec live under a single storage key. Wrapping the ink::prelude::vec::Vec inside Lazy, like the provided example above does, has no influence on its inner layout. If you are dealing with large or sparse arrays on contract storage, consider using a Mapping instead. Manual vs. Automatic Key Generation​ By default, keys are calculated automatically for you, thanks to the AutoKey primitive. They'll be generated at compile time and ruled out for conflicts. However, for non-Packed types like Lazy or the Mapping, the ManualKey primitive allows manual control over the storage key of a field like so: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// The storage key for this field is always `0x0000007f` inner: Lazy<bool, ManualKey<127>>, } This may be advantageous: Your storage key will always stay the same, regardless of the version of your contract or ink! itself (note that the key calculation algorithm may change with future ink! versions). tip Using ManualKey instead of AutoKey might be especially desirable for upgradable contracts, as using AutoKey might result in a different storage key for the same field in a newer version of the contract. This may break your contract after an upgrade 😱! The storage key of the contracts root storage struct defaults to 0x00000000. However, contract developers can set the key to an arbitrary 4 bytes value by providing it a ManualKey like so: /// Manually set the root storage key of `MyContract` to be `0xcafebabe`. #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract<KEY: StorageKey = ManualKey<0xcafebabe>> { value: bool, } Considerations​ It might be worthwhile to think about the desired storage layout of your contract. While using a Packed layout will keep your contracts overall code size smaller, it can cause unnecessarily high gas costs. Thus, we consider it a good practice to break up large or complex storage layouts into reasonably sized distinct storage cells. note ink! Mappings are always non-Packed and loaded lazily, one key-value pair at the time.

Mapping. Here is an example of a mapping from a user to a Balance: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account. balances: ink::storage::Mapping<AccountId, Balance>, } This means that for a given key, you can store a unique instance of a value type. In this case, each \"user\" gets credited their own balance. Example: Using a Mapping​ The following example contract utilizes a Mapping so that anyone can deposit and withdraw balance for their own account: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { use ink::storage::Mapping; #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account ID balances: Mapping<AccountId, Balance>, } impl MyContract { /// Constructor to initialize the contract with an empty mapping. #[ink(constructor, payable)] pub fn new() -> Self { let balances = Mapping::default(); Self { balances } } /// Retrieve the balance of the caller. #[ink(message)] pub fn get_balance(&self) -> Option<Balance> { let caller = self.env().caller(); self.balances.get(caller) } /// Credit more money to the contract. #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn transfer(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0); let endowment = self.env().transferred_value(); self.balances.insert(caller, &(balance + endowment)); } /// Withdraw all your balance from the contract. pub fn withdraw(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap(); self.balances.remove(caller); self.env().transfer(caller, balance).unwrap() } } } Considerations when using the Mapping type​ One of the main purposes of the ink! Mapping is to allow storing a lot of values. note There are many additional data structures accessible under ink::prelude::collections, such as HashMap or BTreeMap (to name a few). Note that these data structures all exhibit Packed storage loading behavior, as opposed to the ink! Mapping! Storage loading behavior​ Each Mapping value lives under it's own storage key. Briefly, this means that Mappings are lazily loaded in ink!. In other words, if your message only accesses a single key of a mapping, it will not load the whole mapping but only the value being accessed. // This causes only a single storage access and the decoding of a single \"MyValue\" struct, // no matter how many elements there are inside the mapping. let foo: MyValue = my_mapping.get(0)?; for n in 0..5 { // This causes a storage access and a decoding operation for each loop iteration. // It is not possible to \"fetch\" all key/value pairs directly at once. let bar: MyValue = my_mapping.get(n)?; } Furthermore, it follows that mapping values do not have a contiguous storage layout, and it is not possible to iterate over the contents of a map. Use fallible storage methods for dynamically sized values​ Reading from or writing to a Mapping implies encoding or decoding the according Mapping key and value. This happens transparently under the hood. However, because the static buffer used to store the encoded data is of limited size, it can fail and trap the contract. note The static buffer defaults to 16KB in size. This can be an issue for values with dynamically sized types. It is recommended to use fallible storage methods (prefixed with try_) for Mappings containing dynamically sized values. Consider a Mapping with String values like so: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { on_chain_log: Mapping<u64, String>, nonce: u64, } If the String overgrows the static buffer size, it will no longer fit into the mapping: #[ink(message)] pub fn do_something(&mut self, data: String) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let log_message = format!(\"{caller:?}: {data}\"); // Panics if log_message overgrows the static buffer size! self.on_chain_log.insert(&self.nonce, &log_message); self.nonce += 1; } Instead, consider using the fallible try_insert method to handle the situation: #[ink(message)] pub fn do_something2(&mut self, data: String) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let log_message = format!(\"{caller:?}: {data}\"); // `try_insert` will not panic but return an error instead. if self .on_chain_log .try_insert(&self.nonce, &log_message) .is_err() { // We get the chance to handle this problem properly: // Restrain the log message to a size guaranteed to fit. let log_message = format!(\"{caller:?}: <data omitted>\"); self.on_chain_log.insert(&self.nonce, &log_message); } self.nonce += 1; } We provide fallible try_ versions for all storage operations on Mapping. Updating values​ The attentive reader may have noticed that accessing mapping values via the Mapping::get() method will result in an owned value (a local copy), as opposed to a direct reference into the storage. Changes to this value won't be reflected in the contract's storage \"automatically\". To avoid this common pitfall, the value must be inserted again at the same key after it was modified. The transfer function from above example illustrates this: pub fn transfer(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); // `balance` is a local value and not a reference to the value on storage! let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0); let endowment = self.env().transferred_value(); // The following line of code would have no effect to the balance of the // caller stored in contract storage: // // balance += endowment; // // Instead, we use the `insert` function to write it back like so: self.balances.insert(caller, &(balance + endowment)); } Edit this page Previous Working with StorageVec Next Storage Layout Example: Using a Mapping Considerations when using the Mapping type Storage loading behavior Use fallible storage methods for dynamically sized values Updating values","s":"Working with Mapping","u":"/5.x/datastructures/mapping","h":"","p":435},{"i":438,"t":"Storage & Data Structures Working with StorageVec Version: 5.0-rc On this page Working with StorageVec In this section we demonstrate how to work with ink!'s StorageVec. Example: Using a StorageVec​ Here is an example of an append-only on-chain log: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account. on_chain_log: ink::storage::StorageVec<String>, } The following example contract utilizes a StorageVec to log each operation on chain (similar to emitting events but the contract can access them). #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { use ink::prelude::{format, string::String}; use ink::storage::StorageVec; #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account. on_chain_log: StorageVec<String>, } impl MyContract { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { on_chain_log: Default::default(), } } /// Donate money to the contract. #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn donate(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let endowment = self.env().transferred_value(); let log_message = format!(\"{caller:?} donated {endowment}\"); self.on_chain_log.push(&log_message); } /// How many donations had the contract so far? #[ink(message)] pub fn log_length(&self) -> u32 { self.on_chain_log.len() } /// What was the last donation to the contract? #[ink(message)] pub fn last_donation(&self) -> Option<String> { self.on_chain_log.peek() } } } Difference between StorageVec and Rusts Vec type​ Any Rust Vec<T> will exhibit Packed storage layout; where StorageVec stores each value under it's own storage key. Hence, any read or write from or to a Vec on storage will load or store all of its elements. This can be undesirable: The cost of reading or writing a single element grows linearly corresponding to the number of elements in the vector (its length). Additionally, the maximum capacity of the whole vector is limited by the size of ink!'s static buffer used during ABI encoding and decoding (default 16 KiB). StorageVec on the other hand allows to access each element individually. Thus, it can theoretically grow to infinite size. However, we currently limit the length at 2 ^ 32 elements. In practice, even if the vector elements are single bytes, it'll allow to store more than 4 GB data in blockchain storage. Caveats​ Iterators are not provided. StorageVec is expected to be used to store a lot elements, where iterating through the elements would be rather inefficient. Manually iterating over the elements using a loop is possible but considered an anti-pattern for most cases. For the same reason, operations which would require re-ordering stored elements are not supported. Examples include inserting and deleting elements at arbitrary positions or sorting elements. The decision whether to use Vec<T> or StorageVec can be seen as an optimization problem with several factors: How large you expect the vector to grow The size of individual elements being stored How frequently reads, writes and iterations happen For example, if a vector is expected to stay small but is frequently iterated over. Choosing a Vec<T> instead of StorageVec will be preferred as individual storage reads are much more expensive as opposed to retrieving and decoding the whole collection with a single storage read. Storage Layout​ At given StorageKey K, the length of the StorageVec is hold. Each element E is then stored under a combination of the StorageVec key K and the elements index. Given StorageVec under key K, the storage key E of the Nth element is calculated as follows: E = scale::Encode((K, N)) Considerations when using the StorageVec type​ StorageVec is a Lazy type similar to Mapping. Hence, the same considerations apply to StorageVec too: Storage loading behavior Use fallible storage methods for dynamically sized values Updating values Rust Docs​ See here for the Rust documentation of this data structure: StorageVec.

It allows third-party tooling to work with contract storage and can also help to better understand the storage layout of any given contract. Given a contract with the following storage: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { balance: Balance, block: BlockNumber, lazy: Lazy<bool>, } The storage will be reflected inside the metadata as like follows: \"root\": { \"layout\": { \"struct\": { \"fields\": [ { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0x00000000\", \"ty\": 0 } }, \"name\": \"balance\" }, { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0x00000000\", \"ty\": 1 } }, \"name\": \"block\" }, { \"layout\": { \"root\": { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0xb1f4904e\", \"ty\": 2 } }, \"root_key\": \"0xb1f4904e\" } }, \"name\": \"lazy\" } ], \"name\": \"MyContract\" } }, \"root_key\": \"0x00000000\" } We observe that the storage layout is represented as a tree, where tangible storage values end up inside a leaf. Because of Packed encoding, leafs can share the same storage key, and in order to reach them you'd need to fetch and decode the whole storage cell under this key. A root_key is meant to either be used to directly access a Packed storage field or to serve as the base key for calculating the actual keys needed to access values in non-Packed fields (such as Mappings). Storage key calculation for ink! Mapping values​ Base storage keys are always 4 bytes in size. However, the storage API of the contracts pallet supports keys of arbitrary length. In order to reach a mapping value, the storage key of said value is calculated at runtime. The formula to calculate the base storage key S used to access a mapping value under the key K for a mapping with base key B can be expressed as follows: S = scale::encode(B) + scale::encode(K) Where the base key B is the root_key (of type u32) found in the contract metadata. In words, SCALE encode the base (root) key of the mapping and concatenate it with the SCALE encoded key of the mapped value to obtain the actual storage key used to access the mapped value. Given the following contract storage, which maps accounts to a balance: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Contract { roles: Mapping<AccountId, Balance, ManualKey<0x12345678>>, } Now let's suppose we are interested in finding the balance for the account 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY. The storage key is calculated as follows: SCALE encode the base key of the mapping (0x12345678u32), resulting in 0x78563412 SCALE encode the AccountId, which will be 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d. Note that you'll need to convert the SS58 into a AccountId32 first. Concatenating those two will result in the key 0x78563412d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d. let account_id = \"5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY\"; let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(account_id).unwrap(); let storage_key = &(0x12345678u32, account).encode(); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(storage_key)); // 0x78563412d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d Accessing storage items with the contractsApi runtime call API​ There are two ways to query for storage fields of smart contracts from outside a contract. Both methods are accessible via the polkadot-js web UI. The straight forward way to query a contracts storage is via a runtime API call, using the contractsApi endpoint provided by the contracts pallet. The endpoint provides a getStorage method, which just expects a contract address and a storage key as arguments. For example, to access the root storage struct under the key 0x00000000 of a contract, just specify the contract's address and the storage key 0x00000000 as-is. The API call will return the scale-encoded root storage struct of the contract. Accessing storage items with the childState RPC call API​ Under the hood, each contract gets its own child trie, where its storage items are actually stored. Additionally, the contracts pallet uses the Blake2 128 Concat Transparent hashing algorithm to calculate storage keys for any stored item inside the child trie. You'll need to account for that as well. With that in mind, to directly access storage items of any on-chain contract using a childState RPC call, you'll need the following: The child trie ID of the contract, represented as a PrefixedStorageKey The hashed storage key of the storage field Finding the contracts child trie ID​ The child trie ID is the Blake2_256 hash of the contracts instantiation nonce concatenated to it's AccountId. You can find it in polkadot-js chainstate query interface, where you need to execute the contracts_contractInfoOf state query. It can also be calculate manually according to the following code snippet. The instantiation note of the contract must be still be known. You can get it using the contracts_nonce chain state query in polkadot-js UI. use sp_core::crypto::Ss58Codec; use parity_scale_codec::Encode; // Given our contract ID is 5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4 let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(\"5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4\").unwrap(); // Given our instantiation nonce was 1 let nonce: u64 = 1; // The child trie ID can be calculated as follows: let trie_id = (&account, nonce).using_encoded(Blake2_256::hash); Calculate the PrefixedStorageKey from the child trie ID​ A PrefixedStorageKey based on the child trie ID can be constructed using the ChildInfo primitive as follows: use sp_core::storage::ChildInfo; let prefixed_storage_key = ChildInfo::new_default(&trie_id).into_prefixed_storage_key(); Calculate the storage key using transparent hashing​ Finally, we calculate the hashed storage key of the storage item we are wanting to access. The algorithm is simple: Blake2_128 hash the storage key and then concatenate the unhashed key to the hash. Given you want to access the storage item under the 0x00000000, it will look like this in code: use frame_support::Blake2_128Concat; // The base key is 0x00000000 let storage_key = Blake2_128Concat::hash(&[0, 0, 0, 0]); A full example​ Let's recap the last few paragraphs into a full example. Given: A contract at address 5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4 With instantiation nonce of 1 The root storage struct is to be found at base key 0x00000000 The following Rust program demonstrates how to calculate the PrefixedStorageKey of the contracts child trie, as well as the hashed key for the storage struct, which can then be used with the chilstate RPC endpoint function getStorage in polkadot-js to receive the root storage struct of the contract: use frame_support::{sp_runtime::AccountId32, Blake2_128Concat, Blake2_256, StorageHasher}; use parity_scale_codec::Encode; use sp_core::{crypto::Ss58Codec, storage::ChildInfo}; use std::ops::Deref; fn main() { // Find the child storage trie ID let account_id = \"5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4\"; let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(account_id).unwrap(); let instantiation_nonce = 1u64; let trie_id = (account, instantiation_nonce).using_encoded(Blake2_256::hash); assert_eq!( hex::encode(trie_id), \"2fa252b7f996d28fd5d8b11098c09e56295eaf564299c6974421aa5ed887803b\" ); // Calculate the PrefixedStorageKey based on the trie ID let prefixed_storage_key = ChildInfo::new_default(&trie_id).into_prefixed_storage_key(); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(prefixed_storage_key.deref())); // 0x3a6368696c645f73746f726167653a64656661756c743a2fa252b7f996d28fd5d8b11098c09e56295eaf564299c6974421aa5ed887803b // Calculate the storage key using transparent hashing let storage_key = Blake2_128Concat::hash(&[0, 0, 0, 0]); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(&storage_key)); // 0x11d2df4e979aa105cf552e9544ebd2b500000000 } Edit this page Previous Custom Data Structures Next Overview Storage key calculation for ink!

Squink is the mascot of ink! and guides new users and adventurers through our presentations workshops and tutorials. It also has a romance with Rust's mascot, Ferris. Generally it is very friendly and open to learning new Rustaceans but be aware to never upset it by taking away dots from the word ink! by spelling it incorrectly! It really is into dots. Stories tell that it demanded the spelling of ink! with as many dots as possible. Is it \"ink\" or \"ink!\"? What does the \"!\" stand for? The correct spelling is ink! ‒ with a lowercase \"i\" and an exclamation mark at the end. The history here is that: …in the very first iteration ink! was originally a declarative Rust macro. A contract was invoked by writing ink!{ … }. …there is a real-world analogy here of writing a paper contract using ink. …we wanted to have as many DOTs as possible in the name 😉. …the symmetry of the top and bottom dot of i and ! is aesthetically pleasing 🌻. So please don't make poor Squink cry having to read !ink, ink, Ink!, or Ink. What's ink!'s relationship to Substrate/Polkadot?​ Substrate is a modular framework to build decentralized applications on top of blockchain technology. Polkadot is a layer-0 blockchain built using Substrate that allows to orchestrate an entire fleet of other blockchains to join forces and communicate with each other. Blockchains built with Substrate can include the so-called pallet-contracts module in order to allow instantiating and executing smart contracts. ink! was built to allow users to write smart contracts in Rust targeting blockchains built by Substrate that have the aforementioned pallet-contracts included. While ink! is currently the most advanced smart contract language targeting Substrate blockchains it is not the only possible choice for users. There is also a Solidity to Wasm compiler called Solang that also allows to target Substrate chains and there are other languages in plan and discovery phase for the same purpose. On the Substrate side the same is true for the pallet-contracts. It is just a module that defines the basic set of features required for executing smart contracts on the blockchain that includes it. However, it is not necessarily the only solution to do exactly that. There is also the evm-pallet to run smart contracts targeting the EVM as well as the experimental actors-pallet that allows to execute smart contracts written in the actor style programming model. Over time the Substrate community might come up with yet other pallets for smart contracts execution. Please see our page How it Works – Substrate for more information. How to call other smart contracts on the same blockchain?​ See the Cross-contract calling section. How to call other smart contracts on another parachain?​ This feature has not yet been implemented by the Substrate side. What is a contract's ABI or Metadata?​ In ink! a smart contract's metadata is retrieved by using the cargo-contract CLI tool and invoking cargo contract build which outputs a .contract file that includes both the compiled .wasm of the ink! smart contract as well as the so-called metadata information of the same smart contract. The metadata is especially important for third party tools such as Polkadot JS Apps or the Contracts UI and provides useful information about the contract's constructors, messages, events, function selectors, documentation and comments of the aforementioned structures as well as how inputs and outputs shall be encoded and decoded respectively etc. Can a re-entrancy bug occur in ink! contracts?​ Yes. However, the Substrate team is well aware of the associated problems and already through about possible future additions to eliminate re-entrancy attacks. How can my smart contract interact with the runtime?​ See the Chain Extensions section for more information. How can I use ink! with a Substrate chain with a custom chain config?​ Please see this section in our documentation. Detailed documentation is found in the Rust docs for the #[ink(contract)] macro. It allows you to specify your environment a la #[ink::contract(env = MyEnvironment)]. What does the #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] at the beginning of each contract mean?​ The #[cfg(..)] or #[cfg_attr(..)] annotations are how Rust does conditional compilation. ink! smart contracts can be compiled in two different modes. Through #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] an ink! smart contract tells the Rust compiler in which mode they are being compiled. This also plays a significant role in how ink! generates the smart contract code. The two modes are as follows: Wasm mode: This is the mode chosen when compiling an ink! smart contract for deployment on a blockchain. The resulting binary is a .wasm file and as such it is not possible to use certain parts of Rust's standard library. Off-chain mode: This is the mode chosen when trying to test an ink! smart contract using the off-chain environment. Off-chain environment testing is very useful to check if certain ink! constructors or messages are well behaving and allow for better debuggability than when trying to debug the same smart contract deployed on a chain. Overflow Safety?​ Being written in Rust, ink! can provide compile-time overflow/underflow safety. Using a Rust compiler configuration, you can specify whether you want to support overflowing math, or if you want contract execution to panic when overflows occur. No need to continually import \"Safe Math\" libraries, although Rust also provides integrated checked, wrapped, and saturated math functions. note There are some known issues regarding functionality of compiler level overflow checks and the resulting size of the Wasm blob. This feature may change or be iterated on in the future. What is the difference between memory and storage?​ In ink!, memory refers to computer memory, while storage refers to the on-chain storage used by a contract instance. Memory is temporary and only lasts until the contract execution is done, while storage is persistent and lasts over many contract executions. The contract storage is built on top of the runtime storage, and access is considered to be slow. How do I print something to the console from the runtime?​ Please see our page on Contract Debugging. Why is Rust's standard library (stdlib) not available in ink!?​ Rust's standard library consists of three different layers: core library which defines everything that has no dependencies outside of Rust itself. Included are types such as Option, Result as well as a whole variety of modules, functions and macro. ink! smart contracts allow authors to use Rust's core crate. alloc library which is depending on a global allocator and mainly defines collections that spill their elements on to the execution's heap memory. Examples for collections are Box, String, Vec, HashMap, LinkedList and modules such as fmt, rc (ref-counted pointers) or borrows. ink! smart contracts allow authors to use Rust's alloc crate. By default ink! authors use definitions from the alloc crate through ink::prelude crate. std library is what people generally call Rust's standard library. The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the broader Rust ecosystem. It requires several operating system capabilities in order to work correctly such as input and output systems for files, networking etc. Since the Wasm (a.k.a. wasm32-unknown-unknown) compilation target does not support Rust's standard library ink! authors cannot use it either for their own purposes. Instead the pallet-contracts tries to provide some common functionality that would otherwise be missing for common smart contract operations. How do I hash a value?​ A number of crypto hashes are built into the pallet-contracts and therefore very efficient to use. We currently support a handful of those, you can view the complete list here. If you have the urgent need for another crypto hash you could introduce it through Chain Extensions or make a proposal to include it into the default set of the pallet-contracts. Using one of the built-in crypto hashes can be done as explained here: self.env().hash_bytes() self.env().hash_encoded() Why is it not possible to use floating point data types in ink!? How do I implement returning a decimal number?​ Floats are cool for all kinds of reasons, but they also have one important drawback. Floating point arithmetic is non-deterministic which means that different processors compute (slightly) different results for the same operation. Although there is an IEEE spec, non-determinism can come from specific libraries used, or even hardware. In order for the nodes in a blockchain network to reach agreement on the state of the chain, all operations must be completely deterministic. Hence we don't allow floating point data types in ink!. Consequently it's not possible to return a decimal number from an ink! message. What you should do instead is to have your user interface denominate the returned number to decimals. Note, that it's typical for blockchains to have the number of available tokens defined as a non-floating number and determine the denomination in the user interface. For example, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to the smallest unit of 100,000,000 Satoshi and all Bitcoin implementations internally persist account balances in Satoshi, not as a decimal number of Bitcoin. Why can't I just use the standard Rust data collections in ink!?​ You can use them! They are exposed via the ink_prelude crate (e.g. ink::prelude::vec::Vec) and you can return them from ink! messages and also persist them to storage. However, the Rust stdlib collections are not optimized for smart contract usage! So for example, if you use them to persist your data on the chain they will always occupy a single storage cell and thus always be loaded eagerly, in their entirety. This can be very costly! Just think about a Vec or a HashMap where the smart contract might only need access to a few elements, rather than the entire data collection. Why am I getting a ContractTrapped error when interacting with a contract?​ When it does not constitute a deliberate assertion, like for example a permission check, it is most likely a bug in your contract or in ink!. A common source of ContractTrapped are Integer overflows, those can cause your contract to trap as well. There is a known bug in the Rust compiler with respect to safe math operations. As a workaround for this particular bug try to insert overflow-checks = false into your Cargo.toml. This will disable safe math operations altogether, but unfortunately we are currently not aware of a better workaround until the bug in the compiler is fixed. If you don't find the issue you can also ask for help in our public Element or Discord channel. What are the Encode, Decode and TypeInfo arguments in #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] ?​ Substrate-based blockchains use the SCALE codec to encode data. As a consequence the data for every interaction with Substrate needs to be SCALE-encodable ‒ i.e. it needs to implement either scale::Encode, scale::Decode, or both. This affects e.g. data you want to return to a caller, data that you want to take as input, or data you want to store on-chain. ink! re-exports these traits and provides a useful macro #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] that allows to derive them in a concise way. A common error you might get when a necessary SCALE trait is not implemented for a data structure could be along the lines of the trait \"WrapperTypeEncode\" is not implemented for \"Foo\". For example, you might encounter this error if you try to store a custom data structure in the contract's storage. Or e.g. when attempting to return a custom error from an ink! message. note The error the trait \"WrapperTypeEncode\" is not implemented for … is also a common error when a mismatching version of parity-scale-codec is used in the contract opposed to the version used by ink!. The solution typically is to add a fitting implementation of the trait for your data structure: Encode is used for encoding a data structure when it is e.g. returned to a caller or when it is persisted to the contracts storage. Decode is used for the inverse, e.g. when reading from storage or taking an input from a user (or another contract). TypeInfo is used to encode the information about the type that is often used for the generation of metadata. It's possible to derive those traits and oftentimes the simplest way is to just derive the missing trait for the object for which its implementation is missing using the ink! macro: #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode)] struct MyCustomDataStructure { … } How do I use String in my contract?​ In general, you should think twice if you really need String. Smart contracts usually don't use strings; those are typically used for user interactions and should live in your UI and not on the chain. Minimizing storage usage of your contract is a best practice and you should only persist items which you need to derive state transitions in your contract. If you still, for some reason, need to use String, then you should use the String from the ink! prelude. Getting a warning in cargo-contract about type compatibility? ink! and Substrate both support the possibility of deciding to deviate from the default types for Balance, BlockNumber, etc. These types are called environment types. If a chain decides on custom environment types, contract authors need to specify these types that deviate from the ink! default environment in their contracts. Otherwise, undefined behavior can occur when uploading a contract with deviating types to a chain. Custom environment types can be specified in ink! via the #[contract(env = MyCustomEnvironment)] attribute. You can read more are about this here. When using cargo-contract to interact with a chain you might get a warning along those lines: Warning: This chain does not yet support checking for compatibility of your contract types. This warning appears when the chain that you are targeting (via the --url cli flag) does not contain a version of pallet-contracts that does support type comparison. Type comparison is a feature that we introduced, it means we check that the environmental types of your contract are equivalent to the environmental types of the chain that you are targeting. It's a safety feature to make sure that you are not accidentally deploying a contract with e.g. type Balance = u128 to a chain with a different Balance type. The cargo-contract warning means this check for compatible types cannot be performed. This check is only available on chains from polkadot-1.2.0 on, specifically from this commit. If a chain indeed requires that contract developers have to use custom environment types, this should be communicated prominently by them.

It also has helpful information like the events that are emitted by the contract or any docs. If you look closely at the constructors and messages, you will also notice a selector which contains a 4-byte hash of the function name and is used to route your contract calls to the correct functions. In the next section we will start a Substrate Smart Contracts node and configure the Contracts UI to interact with it. Debug vs. Release Build​ By default, cargo-contract builds the contract in debug mode. This means that the contract will e.g. print statements like ink::env::debug_println!(\"magic number: {}\", value); to the node's console if debugging was enabled on the node (instructions here). To support functionality like this the debug build of a contract includes some heavy-weight logic. For contracts that are supposed to run in production you should always build the contract with --release: cargo contract build --release This will ensure that nothing unnecessary is compiled into the Wasm blob, making your contract faster and cheaper to deploy and execute. info With this behavior cargo-contract mirrors how cargo behaves for Rust programs: the --release flag has to be passed explicitly to cargo build.

This experience can take many shapes from mobile app to interactive terminal applications. In this section we are focusing on the most prominent shape in web3 right now, web apps. Although we love Rust, the native language of the web is JavaScript. Thereby naturally the best tools for creating web experiences are available for JavaScript. Hence, the tools for smart contract interaction with JavaScript are the most advanced as well. To be precise all JavaScript tools mentioned here, actually leverage TypeScript to offer a JavaScript and a typesafe TypeScript experience. JavaScript/TypeScript Tools​ There are several levels of abstraction where you can start your journey creating a web frontend for your contracts. Each levels offers different advantages and disadvantages. The following list is of tools. They are sorted from the most generic no third party library way to interact with Polkadot's smart contracts to the most opinionated template using libraries and proven frontend frameworks. Using no libraries​ RPC Interface (not recommended): nodes participating in the blockchain network offer an JSON RPC interface to interact with the blockchains state and capabilities. Low level libraries​ @polkadot/api (not recommended): allows for most general interaction with Polkadot-SDK based blockchains from JavaScript. In order to talk to smart-contracts, one would use the pallet-contracts runtime calls. @polkadot/api-contract (recommended): abstraction on top of @polkadot/api for the pallet-contracts. Makes interaction with smart contracts more comfortable and type safe. React​ useInkathon (recommended): A hooks library for the popular frontend javascript framework React with focus on smart-contract interactions. Built using @polkadot/api & @polkadot/api-contract. React and Next.js​ inkathon (recommended): Full Stack web app template using the popular full stack template Nextjs. Itself is using useInkathon. The fastest way to get up and running with a smart contract and a corresponding web app. Examples​ For inspiration how to get started building your full stack dApp. Make sure to visit our Smart Contracts Examples section or repository directly. These examples not only offer the smart contract code but also have an accompanied frontend project. Checkout the README.md for details how to setup and run these frontend examples. Other Languages​ Of course the browser and JavaScript should not be the one and only platform for smart contract frontends. It's just the most mature for smart contract frontend tooling. The following is a list of libraries which could be used to craft smart-contract dApps on other platforms than the web. novasamatech/substrate-sdk-ios: low level generic iOS SDK for substrate. novasamatech/substrate-sdk-android: low level Android SDK for substrate. paritytech/subxt: Rust library to submit extrinsics (transactions) to a substrate node via RPC. polkascan/py-substrate-interface: Python library to interface with Substrate nodes.

Flipper only has two functions: flip() and get(). We will show you what it's like to play with both of them. RPC calls vs. Transactions​ There are two ways of calling a contract: Dry-run via RPC​ Remote procedure calls, or RPC methods, are a way for an external program – for example, a browser or front-end application – to communicate with a Substrate node. For example, you might use an RPC method to read a stored value, submit a transaction, or request information about the chain a node is connected to. If a user interface displays the value of a contract (e.g. the balance of an account in an ERC-20 contract), then this is typically done via RPC. Specifically it is done by executing a synchronous dry-run of the contract method and returning its result. The following schema depicts this. RPC calls don't require any tokens, they just require a connection to a node in the network. It's important to note that the execution won't result in any state mutations on the blockchain, it really just is a dry-run. State mutating via submitting a Transaction​ The other method of executing a call to a contract is by submitting a transaction on-chain. This requires tokens of the network to pay for the cost of the transaction. The transaction will be put in a transaction pool and asynchronously processed. The important implication here is that during submission of the transaction no result is available. This is different from an RPC call. The typical pattern for how a client can recognize the result of the contract call is to have the contract emit an event and have the client actively listen for such an event. Typically libraries (like polkadot-js/api) provide API functions to do just that. The important take-away is that contract developers have to make sure that events are emitted if they want clients to be able to pick up on them. Using the Contracts UI​ 1. get() function​ We set the initial value of the Flipper contract value to false when we instantiated the contract. Let's check that this is the case. In the Message to Send section, select the \"get(): bool\" message and accept the default values for the other options. Press \"Read\" and confirm that it returns the value false: 2. flip() function​ So let's make the value turn true now! The alternative message to send with the UI is flip(). Again, accept the default values for the other options and click Call contract If the transaction was successful, we should then be able to go back to the get() function and see our updated storage: Using cargo-contract​ Calling a contract can also be done via the command-line! 1. get() function​ cargo contract build cargo contract upload --suri //Alice cargo contract instantiate --execute --suri //Alice --args true # The output of this command will contain the contract address, # insert it in the command below. # e.g Contract 5DXR2MxThkyZvG3s4ubu9yRdNiifchZ9eNV8i6ErGx6u1sea cargo contract call --contract <insert-contract-address> --message get --suri //Alice 2. flip() function​ cargo contract call --contract <insert-contract-address> --message flip --execute --suri //Alice Edit this page Previous Deploy Your Contract Next Troubleshooting RPC calls vs. Transactions Dry-run via RPC State mutating via submitting a Transaction Using the Contracts UI 1. get() function 2. flip() function Using cargo-contract 1. get() function 2. flip() function","s":"Call Your Contract","u":"/5.x/getting-started/calling-your-contract","h":"","p":455},{"i":458,"t":"Getting started Creating an ink! Project Version: 5.0-rc On this page Creating an ink! Project ink! is an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) that you can use to write WebAssembly based smart contracts in the Rust programming language. ink! is just standard Rust in a well defined \"contract format\" with specialized #[ink(…)] attribute macros. These attribute macros tell ink! what the different parts of your Rust smart contract represent, and ultimately allow ink! to do all the magic needed to create Substrate compatible Wasm bytecode! Use the ink! CLI to generate an initial smart contract with some scaffolding code. Make sure you are in your working directory, and then run: cargo contract new flipper This command will create a new project folder named flipper with this content: flipper └─ lib.rs <-- Contract Source Code └─ Cargo.toml <-- Rust Dependencies and ink! Configuration └─ .gitignore Contract Source Code​ The ink CLI automatically generates the source code for the \"Flipper\" contract, which is about the simplest \"smart\" contract you can build. You can take a sneak peak as to what will come by looking at the source code here: Flipper Example Source Code. The Flipper contract is nothing more than a bool which gets flipped from true to false through the flip() function. Testing Your Contract​ You will see at the bottom of the source code there are simple test cases which verify the functionality of the contract. We can quickly test this code is functioning as expected using the off-chain test environment that ink! provides.

On this page we outline how you can migrate existing clients and contracts from 3.x to 4.0. caution This migration guide is only for your code base! If you have an existing contract on-chain you cannot just upgrade the code on-chain ‒ you also have to migrate your data, since the way ink! 4.0 stores data and reads it (i.e. the storage layout) changes from ink! 3.x to 4.0. Compatibility​ ink! 4.0 is compatible with: Stable Rust >= 1.63.0 scale >=3 scale-info >= 2.3 pallet-contracts >= polkadot-v0.9.37 substrate-contracts-node >= v0.24.0 polkadot-js/api and polkadot-js/api-contract >= 9.10.2 cargo-contract 2.0​ Together with ink! 4.0 we've released cargo-contract 2.0. You have to use this latest version of cargo-contract for ink! 4.0 contracts. You can upgrade via: cargo install cargo-contract --force --version 2 Make sure that e.g. your CI also uses cargo-contract 2 with ink! 4. If you have wrapper scripts around cargo-contract you should ensure that this version is enforced, otherwise users will get an error. note cargo-contract no longer requires binaryen or wasm-opt as an external dependency. We required those because of wasm-opt tool (which is part of binaryen). Fortunately we were able to find a way of installing wasm-opt now as part of the cargo-contract installation process. Rust stable instead of nightly​ ink! 4.0 and cargo-contract use stable Rust now. This means no more cargo +nightly contract is required, you can just use a stable Rust toolchain now (>= Rust 1.63). New entrance ink crate​ The ink_lang crate has been replaced in #1223 by a new top level ink crate. All existing sub-crates are reexported and should be used via the new ink crate, so e.g. ink::env instead of ink_env. Contract authors should now import the top level ink crate instead of the individual crates. Migration​ In Cargo.toml Replace all individual ink_* crate dependencies with the ink crate. In the contract source: Remove the commonly used use ink_lang as ink idiom. Replace all usages of individual crates with reexports, e.g. ink_env ➜ ink::env. Storage API + Layout​ With #1331 the way ink! reads and writes to a contract's storage changed. Storage keys are generated at compile-time, and user facing abstractions which determine how contract data is laid out in storage are different now. Migration​ Initialize Mapping fields with Mapping::default() instead of ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract in constructors. See erc20 and other examples which use a Mapping. SpreadAllocate, SpreadLayout, PackedLayout, PackedAllocate have been removed. Removal of wee-alloc support​ ink! uses a bump allocator by default, additionally we supported another allocator (wee-alloc) through a feature flag. wee-alloc is no longer maintained and we removed support for it in #1403. Removal of eth_compatibility crate​ As part of #1233 the eth_compatibility crate was removed. The ecdsa_to_eth_address() function from it can now be found in the ink_env crate. ink_env::ecdsa_to_eth_address(&pub_key, &mut output); ink_storage::Mapping​ The function signature of Mapping::insert(key, val) changed to Mapping::insert(key, val) -> Option<u32>. The return value is the size of the pre-existing value at the specified key if any (in bytes). Two new useful functions were added: Mapping::contains(key) in #1224. Mapping::take() to get a value while removing it from storage in #1461. In case you were working around those two functions you can now use them directly; they are more gas-efficient than e.g. executing a get(key).is_none() instead of contains(key). Storage functions in ink_env​ As part of #1224 the return type of ink_env::set_contract_storage() was changed to return an Option<u32> instead of (). A new function ink_env::take_contract_storage was introduced. Removal of ink_env::random function​ We had to remove the ink_env::random function (in #1442). This function allowed contract developers getting random entropy. There is unfortunately no way how this can be done safely enough with built-in Substrate primitives on-chain currently. We're following the recommendation of our auditors to remove it. The alternative right now is to provide random entropy off-chain to the contract, to use a random entropy oracle, or to have a chain-extension that does this, in case the chain has a possibility to do so. We hope to bring this function back in a future release of ink!, the best hope right now is that it could come back with Sassafras, a block production protocol for future versions of Polkadot. If you're interested in more information on this check out the Substrate PR which deprecated the random interface of pallet-contracts. Constructors can now return Result<Self, MyContractError>​ With #1446 we introduced the possibility for constructors to return either Self (as usual) or Result<Self, MyContractError>. This enables contract developers to bubble up encoded error objects to clients/frontends about a failure. In ink! 3.x it was only possible to panic in the constructor in case an error occurred, resulting in loss of this information. Chain extension's returns_result removed​ The returns_result flag has been removed from the #[ink(extension = …)] attribute in #1569. We now infer this information at compile time. If handle_status is set to true, the return type will still be wrapped into Result as before. Contract Metadata (ABI)​ The most detailed way to grasp what changed is to look at this PR, which updated the metadata page in our documentation. Add support for language level errors (LangError)​ Under the hood, ink! now generates code that results in each message and constructor returning a Result<Message::Output, LangError> (or for constructors Result<Constructor::Output, LangError>). This happens even if the message/constructor doesn't have a return type, we default to the unit type () in that case. A LangError is a type of error which doesn't originate from the contract itself, nor from the underlying execution environment (so the Contracts pallet in this case). An example of where this would arise is if a caller tries to use a non-existent message selector for a contract. Previously, the contract would trap and not allow the caller to do any sort of error handling if it encountered a non-existent selector. This change doesn't affect how you write a contract! It affects clients and frontends though, since it breaks the API in two ways: first, all contract messages now have a Result return type, and second a new field, lang_error, will be introduced as part of the contract spec. The second change allows other languages (such as Solang) to use an equivalent LangError. Click here for a snippet of the new metadata for the Flipper contract. \"messages\": [ { \"args\": [], \"docs\": [ \" Flips the current value of the Flipper's boolean.\" ], \"label\": \"flip\", \"mutates\": true, \"payable\": false, \"returnType\": { \"displayName\": [ \"ink\", \"MessageResult\" ], \"type\": 1 }, \"selector\": \"0x633aa551\" }], \"lang_error\": { \"displayName\": [ \"ink\", \"LangError\" ], \"type\": 3 }, { \"id\": 3, \"type\": { \"def\": { \"variant\": { \"variants\": [ { \"index\": 1, \"name\": \"CouldNotReadInput\" } ] } }, \"path\": [ \"ink_primitives\", \"LangError\" ] } } Version field​ As part of #1313 the ink! ABI was changed to have a proper version field as part of the ink! metadata object. This enables querying the ABI version in a less-ambiguous way. Before: \"source\": {...}, \"contract\": {...}, \"V3\": { \"spec\": {...}, \"storage\": {...}, \"types\": {...} } After: { \"source\": {...}, \"contract\": {...}, \"spec\": {...}, \"storage\": {...}, \"types\": [...], \"version\": \"4\" } The Storage Layout (storage)​ The storage layout under the storage key changed for v4. If you have an application that is using it consider reading the updated documentation: General storage documentation Storage metadata format Removal of AccountId Default implementation​ In #1255 we removed the Default trait implementation on AccountIds. The Default implementation of AccountId returned the zero-address, which is problematic since the zero-address in the sr25519 and ed25519 curves has a known private key. Developers commonly reach for defaults, and the zero-address in particular, making it an unsafe trait implementation to have given the consequences. Imagine a developer sending tokens to the zero-address to be burned, only to find that they've been stolen because the private key is known. If you were previously using AccountId's Default implementation in your code you have a couple of different options for how to move forward. These will depend on what exactly you were using the zero-address for. If you were using it as a burn address: You can pick another address to use, assuming that you've actually picked a random address Consider a solution that involves reducing total issuance, instead of transferring tokens to a random address If you were using it as a privileged account: Change the account Add checks to ensure that calls coming from the zero-address are rejected You should also now consider dealing with AccountId's as Option<AccountId>'s. This is more idiomatic Rust, and also conveys the meaning of a \"null\" or \"empty\" address much better. Updates to the CallBuilder and CreateBuilder APIs​ There's been several changes to the CallBuilder and CreateBuilder APIs. In #1604 we renamed the CallBuilder::fire() method to CallBuilder::invoke(). This brings more consistency across our APIs which were already using the invoke terminology. In #1512 and #1525 we added support for handing LangErrors from the CreateBuilder and CallBuilder, respectively. If you want to handle errors from either Builder you can use the new CreateBuilder::try_instantiate() or CallBuilder::try_invoke() methods. Because of the addition of those methods we also removed any error handling from the non-try_ methods in #1602. This means that the CallBuilder::invoke() and CreateBuilder::instantiate() methods return values directly, and panic when they encounter an error. Lastly, in #1636 we added two methods to the CallBuilder to streamline Call and DelegateCall workflows: For Call you can use CallBuilder::call() (this replaces CallBuilder::callee()) For DelegateCall you can use CallBuilder::delegate() Removal of [lib.crate-type] and [lib.name] from contract manifest​ Earlier versions of cargo-contract required that these two fields were specified in the contract manifest explicitly, as follows: [lib] name = \"flipper\" path = \"lib.rs\" crate-type = [ # Used for normal contract Wasm blobs. \"cdylib\", # Use to generate ABI \"rlib\", ] However, with with cargo-contract#929 we changed this behavior to: Use the contract name by default, removing the need for the name field Compile contracts as rlibs by default, and automatically changing to cdylib as needed This means that your new manifest should look like: [lib] path = \"lib.rs\" Edit this page Previous Migrating from ink! 4.x to 5.0 Next ink!

Analyzer Version: 5.0-rc On this page ink! Analyzer ink! analyzer is a collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools for semantic analysis of ink! smart contract code. ink! analyzer aims to improve ink! language support in integrated development environments (IDEs), source code editors and other development tools by providing modular and reusable building blocks for implementing language features (e.g. diagnostic errors, quick fixes, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content e.t.c) for the ink! programming language. Semantic Analyzer (source code, crates.io, docs.rs). Language Server (source code, binary/executable releases, crates.io, docs.rs). Visual Studio Code Extension (source code, VS Code Marketplace listing, VSIX releases). Problem​ While ink! developers can leverage Rust tooling and excellent IDE/code editor support via rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust because \"ink! is just standard Rust in a well-defined \"contract format\" with specialized #[ink(…)] attribute macros\", relying on only generic Rust language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools has some significant limitations for the developer experience including: No language support (e.g. diagnostic errors/warnings and quick fixes) for ink!'s domain specific semantic rules for smart contracts (e.g. exactly one #[ink(storage)] struct, at least one #[ink(message)] method and the same for #[ink(constructor)], ink! attributes should be applied to items of the correct type e.t.c). Inconsistent editor experience with issues like no code completion and/or hover content for some ink! attribute arguments (e.g #[ink(payable)]) because macro expansion/name resolution and trait resolution are hard problems for generic IDE/code editor tools (see also https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2021/11/21/ides-and-macros.html). No language support (e.g. go to definition, find references and rename/refactor) for ink! specific syntax like paths in ink! attribute argument values (e.g. env values). Solution​ To solve the above challenges and improve ink! language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools, ink! analyzer creates two main components: A modular domain-specific semantic analysis library for ink! built on a resilient and lossless parser. A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation built on top of the aforementioned semantic analysis library. These two components can be reused to add ink! language support to multiple IDEs, code editors and other development tools. In particular, a large number of IDEs and code editors support LSP servers either via configurable LSP clients or robust LSP client libraries/APIs/modules, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, Acme, Lapce, Eclipse and many more. ink! analyzer makes it relatively easy for: Users to enable ink! language support for their IDE, code editor or other development tool if it has either a native/built-in or third-party LSP client that can be configured to launch an LSP server using an executable command (i.e. the path to an installed ink! Language Server binary) and can use stdio (standard in/standard out) as the message transport. Developers to either build extensions/plugins/integrations that add ink! language support to any tool with robust LSP client libraries/APIs/modules, or add first-class ink! language support to an existing LSP client (e.g. an open-source extension/plugin/integration). In addition to distributing compiled ink! Language Server (ink-lsp-server) binaries for most of the major platforms/architectures, ink! analyzer additionally distributes a Visual Studio Code extension that ships with a bundled ink!

Smart contract deployment on Substrate is a little different than on traditional smart contract blockchains. Whereas a completely new blob of smart contract source code is deployed each time you push a contract on other platforms, Substrate opts to optimize this behavior. For example, the standard ERC20 token has been deployed to Ethereum thousands of times, sometimes only with changes to the initial configuration (through the Solidity constructor function). Each of these instances take up space on the blockchain equivalent to the contract source code size, even though no code was actually changed. In Substrate, the contract deployment process is split into two steps: Putting your contract code on the blockchain Creating an instance of your contract With this pattern, contract code like the ERC20 standard can be put on the blockchain one single time, but instantiated any number of times. No need to continually upload the same source code over and waste space on the blockchain. Using the Contracts UI​ 1. Upload Contract Code​ Here we will upload the contract code and instantiate one copy of the contract on the blockchain (which is usually why we upload the contract code in the first place): Go to https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/ Click the Add New Contract button in the sidebar. Click the Upload New Contract Code button in the Add New Contract page. Choose an Instantiation account (e.g. ALICE). Give the contract a descriptive Name (e.g. Flipper Contract). Drag the flipper.contract file that contains the bundled Wasm blob and metadata into the drag & drop area. You will see the UI parse the metadata and enabling the button that takes you to the next step. Click the Next button 2. Instantiate a Contract on the Blockchain​ Smart contracts exist as an extension of the account system on the blockchain. Thus creating an instance of this contract will create a new AccountId which will store any balance managed by the smart contract and allow us to interact with the contract. Now a screen displays the information that represents our smart contract. We are going to instantiate a copy of the smart contract: Accept the default options for the contract Deployment Constructor. Accept the default options Max Gas Allowed of 200000. Click on Next The transaction is now queued, review your data and click Upload and Instantiate or go back and modify your inputs.

CLI​ The first tool we will be installing is cargo-contract, a CLI tool for helping setting up and managing WebAssembly smart contracts written with ink!. You can find it here on GitHub and here on crates.io. The tool has a number of handy capabilities: $ cargo contract Utilities to develop Wasm smart contracts Usage: cargo contract <COMMAND> Commands: new Setup and create a new smart contract project build Compiles the contract, generates metadata, bundles both together in a `<name>.contract` file check Check that the code builds as Wasm; does not output any `<name>.contract` artifact to the `target/` directory test Test the smart contract off-chain upload Upload contract code instantiate Instantiate a contract call Call a contract decode Decodes a contracts input or output data (supplied in hex-encoding) help Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s) Options: -h, --help Print help information -V, --version Print version information Installation​ Please see the installation instructions in the cargo-contract repository here. If everything worked, cargo contract --help should show you the above list of available commands. Installing substrate-contracts-node​ The substrate-contracts-node is a simple Substrate blockchain which is configured to include the Substrate module for smart contract functionality – the contracts pallet (see How it Works for more). It's a comfortable option if you want to get a quickstart. There are two ways of installing the node: (1) Download the Binary​ This is the recommended method, you can download a binary from our releases page (Linux and Mac). (2) Build it yourself​ Alternatively you can build the node by yourself.

It aims to ease development of and interaction with Wasm smart contracts and provides simple tools to bootstrap contract environment (project) with contract and integration tests templates, manage local node and accounts, language agnostic compile, deploy contracts to both local and remote networks, compatibility checks between the contract pallet and compiler... With all of the features mentioned above, even more is in active or planned development. The whole project is public, and everyone is welcome to contribute or suggest features: Swanky CLI repo Swanky CLI project info Templates provided in the current version of swanky-cli, as well as environment and supported tools target ink! v4, and use cargo contract v2 Installing​ The CLI can be installed and used in different ways: using a preconfigured environment of a dev-container downloading a precompiled binary as an npm package caution Note that using the precompiled binaries, NPM, or compiling it yourself requires you to have the local environment set up correctly Dev container (Recommended)​ Using dev container is the recommended method to use swanky-cli, it includes all the environment setup and will support auto-updates in the future. To run your project in the dev container follow the steps on swanky-dev-container Github. Download the precompiled binaries​ Download the correct archive for your platform from the releases section of swanky-cli github page. Extract the archive to the appropriate location, for example the software directory. Add the swanky executable to your path variable by creating a symbolic link to it from a common bin directory or somewhere similar. MacOS Debian/Ubuntu ln -s /Users/my_name/software/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin ln -s /home/my_name/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin Globally with npm​ This approach may seem simpler, but due to the nature of Node.js dependency management, may result in version inconsistency or other errors. $ npm install -g @astar-network/swanky-cli or $ npx @astar-network/swanky-cli [command] Using swanky-cli​ If you're using a dev container, or have followed the installation instructions, you should have swanky command available in your terminal. Running it without any arguments (or with -h/--help) will provide you with a list of top-level commands and the app version. Passing help as an argument and providing it -n/--nested-commands flag will show full list of commands, including nested ones: swanky help --nested-commands Full list of commands Note that every command and subcommand also supports -h/--help flags to display their usage instructions. Likewise, most of the commands support -v /--verbose flag, which you can use to get more detailed output (useful for debugging and reporting errors). Bootstrap a new project​ Using the swanky init command, you'll be prompted for a series of answers to define your project and the first smart contract within it. After gathering all the required information, the app will proceed to check your environment, scaffold the project, download and install (optionally) swanky node and the project dependencies. swanky init PROJECT_NAME Init process The resulting folder structure should look something like this: Folder structure Resources: swanky init command usage manual available templates Check dependencies and compatibility​ You can quickly check the presence and versions of required dependencies by running swanky check command. Verify dependencies info For now, you will need to be be in a project folder to run this command. This command will be updated to fix that, and provide more useful information. Resources: swanky check command usage manual Manage accounts​ Create and list accounts used for contract interaction. These are the accounts stored inside your swanky.config.json, so the command needs to be ran from within the project directory. During account creation you'll have an option of passing your own mnemonic, or have Swanky generate one for you by passing -g flag. You can also mark the account as \"production\" which will require you to set a password and encrypt the mnemonic. Be careful not to use a dev account on live networks, as their mnemonic is stored in plain text in the config! Creating and listing accounts tip Newly generated accounts that are not the preconfigured dev accounts (Alice, Bob, Charlie...) will have no funds initially, so you'll have to transfer some manually. Resources: swanky account command usage manual Interact with contracts​ swanky contract command offers several subcommands for different interactions with your contracts. Different `contract` subcommands The command names are self explanatory, and to get more detailed information on using a specific command, you can use the help flag with it: swanky contract SUB_COMMAND --help Compile​ Depending on the contracts definition in swanky.config.json, calling swanky contract compile CONTRACT_NAME will run either cargo-contract or ask! compiler (via npm script). If you have multiple contracts and wish to compile them all at once, you can pass the --all flag instead of the contract name. Likewise, if you're compiling for production, you need to pass the --prod flag. Compile all contracts Resources: swanky account command usage manual Get detailed contract description​ Compiling the contract will generate it's metadata too. Swanky provides contract explain CONTRACT_NAME command to get a more human friendly version of that metadata: Getting contract metadata information Resources: contract compile command usage manual Run E2E tests​ You can test your contracts using Mocha framework and Chai assertions. note Please note these tests are not ink! E2E tests, but are written in TypeScript, and require a local node to be running. You can get more information on ink! E2E test framework in the ink! documentation. A contract template will provide you with a simple test as well, which you can use as a starting point. The tests utilize @polkadot/api library, and contract types generated by typechain-polkadot. The types are generated during the compile step and copied to test/*/typedContract/ directory, along with the contract artifacts in the test/*/artifacts/ directory. If you need only the types generated (if you for example deleted or edited them), you can do that without going through the whole compilation step by using swanky contract typegen command. Running swanky contract test CONTRACT_NAME will detect all *.test.ts files in the test/contract_name/ directory, and run them sequentially, or in all directories inside test/ if you pass the -a/--all flag. Run tests for a contract tip Running the tests programmatically may throw warnings about duplicate dependencies on @polkadot/* libraries. This occurs because those libraries are included in swanky app itself, as well as in the test files. Apart from the warning text spamming, no negative consequence of this has been observed. If you want to avoid the warnings anyway, you can run tests as a yarn/npm command: yarn test or npm run test Web based report will be generated and stored in artifacts/ directory. You can copy the path of the reports and use the serve app to view them in browser. (serve is included in swanky-dev-container) serve PATH_TO_REPORTS Web based test report Resources: swanky contract test command usage manual Deploy your contract​ When your contract is compiled and tested, you can deploy it to a local node or a remote network. You will need to supply account you wish to deploy the contract from (-account), max amount of gas to be used (-g), and any arguments required by your contract's constructor (-a). By default, your contract will be deployed to a local node, but you can pass a custom network via -n/--network flag. Available networks are configured in swanky.config.json file. Deploying the contract Successfully running the deploy command will print out the address your contract is deployed to, as well as save it into swanky.config.json Resources: swanky contract deploy command usage manual Run queries and transactions​ Once your contract is deployed, you can call it from the CLI using query or tx commands. Use query for read-only calls, and tx for the calls that change the chain state and require signing (and a gas fee). Both commands require CONTRACT_NAME and MESSAGE_NAME parameters, and for tx a caller account needs to be provided too. (-a/--account). If the message you're calling requires arguments to be passed, you can do that using -p/--param flag. Calling a query on a contract Calling a transaction on a contract Result of a query is straight forward, OK followed by what ever the response is. The transaction (tx) is a bit more raw though. Important to note are the dispatchError and internalError fields, plus the status field. If the errors are undefined, and the status finalized, your transaction has been successful. tip Gas fee for tx is calculated and applied automatically, but you can provide a gas limit manually by using the -g/--gas flag. Keep in mind that the transaction will fail if you provide too low a value. Resources: swanky contract query command usage manual swanky contract tx command usage manual Add a new contract from template​ You can create additional contracts in the same project, using the contract new command and selecting from predefined templates. The contract will be referred by name when using the relevant contract commands, and you can check the details in swanky.config.json Adding a new contract Resources: swanky contract new command usage manual Interact with a local node​ If you have chosen to download and use the Swanky Node during init step, you can use swanky node commands to start and manage it. Simply running swanky node start will start the node, and the node will preserve the state across restarts. If you want to reset the node state, use the swanky node purge command. Starting the swanky node info Note that node needs to be running if you are using a default local network with deploy, query and tx commands. caution If you want to use an external UI to interact with the node, you might run into some CORS issues. This can be solved by passing a custom array of whitelisted urls using the --rpcCors flag. Resources: swanky node commands usage manual Using plugins​ Swanky CLI's functionality can be extended by the use of plugins, and it's a way to add new, case specific commands without modifying the core codebase. One WIP example is the Phala plugin info If you are interested in developing a plugin, you can refer to the Phala example, and the Oclif plugin documentation, or you can post a request in swanky-cli repo's issues.

On this page we outline how you can migrate existing clients and contracts from 4.x to 5.0. This release addresses the majority of issues raised in the OpenZeppelin security review. In particular, we addressed the proxy selector clashing attack. You can find the full changelog of the 5.0 release here. caution This migration guide only considers your code base! Not your storage data! If you have an existing contract on-chain you might not be able to just upgrade the code on-chain, you possibly also have to migrate your storage data. The relevant change that you have to take into consideration is #1897. A data migration may be required when your contract reads data from storage and truncates the data when decoding it. We've described this in more detail below, in the section \"Fail when decoding from storage and not all bytes consumed\". How to upgrade​ Change the dependency versions of ink and ink_e2e in your contracts Cargo.toml to 5. Update your local cargo-contract installation to 4.0. Read through this page. Compatibility​ The following chains are in production and support ink! 5.0: cargo-contract 4.0​ Together with ink! 5.0 we've released cargo-contract 4.0. info You have to use cargo-contract >= 4.0 for ink! 5.0 contracts! You can upgrade via: cargo install cargo-contract --version ^4 Make sure that e.g. your CI also uses at least cargo-contract 4.0 with ink! v5.0. If you have wrapper scripts around cargo-contract, you should ensure that this version is enforced, otherwise users will get an error. Substrate​ The same requirements as for ink! 4.0 hold. pallet-contracts >= polkadot-v0.9.37. substrate-contracts-node >= v0.24.0 How do I find out which Polkadot version a chain is running on?​ You can query the contracts::palletVersion() via the chain state RPCs. It has to be >= 9 for ink! 5.0 to be compatible. You can use e.g. the polakdot.js app to do this: Developer » Chain State » contracts » palletVersion() » Click on the + on the right. Tooling & Libraries​ Stable Rust >= 1.75 cargo-contract >= v4.0 polkadot-js/api and polkadot-js/api-contract >= TODO use-inkathon >= TODO ink!athon >= TODO Important Changes​ scale dependencies were moved to ink entrance crate​ This change was done to ensure that you always use the correct scale dependency versions with an ink! version. The relevant PR is #1890. We removed the requirement for contracts to have direct dependencies on parity-scale-codec and scale-info in their Cargo.toml. You can now remove those dependencies from your contracts Cargo.toml: ink = { version = \"4.3\", default-features = false } -scale = { package = \"parity-scale-codec\", version = \"3\", default-features = false, features = [\"derive\"] } -scale-info = { version = \"2.6\", default-features = false, features = [\"derive\"], optional = true } Both crates have been re-exported from the ink umbrella crate: ink::scale_info and ink::scale. We created a convenience macro to derive the re-exported traits ink::scale::Encode, ink::scale::Decode and ink::scale_info::TypeInfo. // Previously #[scale::Encode, scale::Decode)] #[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(::scale_info::TypeInfo))] pub enum Error {} // Now #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum Error {} The documentation of the macro can be found here. Wildcard selectors: only one other message is allowed in the contract besides the wildcard selector​ Following our security review by OpenZeppelin, we've tightened the usage of wildcard selectors. With ink! 5.0 we allow only exactly one other contract message with a well-known reserved selector to be defined. In ink! 4.x, more than one other message was allowed. Read more in the PR and IIP-2: Limit contracts with a wildcard selector to one other message. The proposal is to restrict contracts with a wildcard selector to only have one other message with a reserved/well-known selector. This guarantees that there are no selector clashes, either by chance or malicious intent, and that the Proxy will only handle messages intended for it. If a contract uses a wildcard selector #[ink(message, payable, selector = _)] it MAY define one other message. This message MUST use the reserved selector @. This selector MUST only be used in conjunction with a wildcard selector. /// Handles any message with no matching selector in this proxy contract #[ink(message, selector = _)] pub fn fallback(&self) { // forward call to the \"logic\" contract which actually executes the call } #[ink::scale_derive(Decode)] pub enum ProxyMessage { UpgradeContract(Hash), } /// One other message allowed to handle messages. /// Fails to compile unless `@` is used as the selector. #[ink(message, selector = @)] pub fn handler(&self, msg: ProxyMessage) { match msg { ProxyMessage(hash) => { } } } /// An additional message. Fails to compile when uncommented. // #[ink(message)] // pub fn additional_message(&self, msg: ProxyMessage) { // match msg { // ProxyMessage(hash) => ... // } // } Events 2.0​ In prior ink! versions, events were defined inside the #[ink::contract] macro. With ink! 5.0 we decouple events from the #[ink::contract] macro, allowing events to be shared between contracts. We've updated the Events documentation page accordingly. The syntax of defining events within the main #[ink::contract] macro will continue to work, no code changes in existing contracts are required to update to the new syntax. caution The topic calculation changed in general, so also for events that are declared inside the #[ink::contract] macro! This is a breaking change for any client code which uses topics to filter events. Please see #1827 for details. Custom signature topics​ In #2031 we introduced an optional attribute signature_topic to the #[ink::event] and #[ink(event)] macros. It can be used to specify the signature topic for a specific event manually, instead of the automatic topic calculation. No more unchecked arithmetic​ Unchecked arithmetic operations in a contract are no longer supported for arithmetic safety reasons. Compiling a contract that contains those will fail gracefully. If you haven't already done, you now need to handle overflows that could occur. Rust supports different possibilities of doing so (saturating, \"wrap around\", and unchecked arithmetic operations) . See this section of the Rust Programming Language for a thorough explanation on how to do safe arithmetic operations in Rust. This change was introduced in #1831. Fail when decoding from storage and not all bytes consumed​ If a contract previously relied on successful decoding which does not consume all bytes, then recompiling with a version of ink! which includes this change will cause that contract to trap at runtime when attempting to decode. A simple example would be if a storage cell contains some bytes which were in the first place an encoded u32. If the contract attempts to decode those into a u8 this would previously have succeeded, now the contract would trap. Here's a code example of behavior that previously worked for ink! 4.x, but would error now: let key = 0u32; let value = [0x42; 32]; ink::env::set_contract_storage(&key, &value); // Only attempt to read the first byte (the `u8`) of the storage value data let _loaded_value: Option<u8> = ink::env::get_contract_storage(&key) .map_err(|e| format!(\"get_contract_storage failed: {:?}\", e))?; We introduced this change in #1897. [ink_e2e] API Changes​ Builder API​ In #1917 we reworked the E2E API with a builder API. instantiate, call and upload will now return a builder instance. You can specify optional arguments with builder methods, and submit the call for on-chain execution with the .submit() method, or dry-run it with dry_run(). let contract = client .instantiate(\"flipper\", &ink_e2e::alice(), &mut constructor) .submit() .await .expect(\"instantiate failed\"); let mut call_builder = contract.call_builder::<Flipper>(); let get = call_builder.get(); let get_res = client.call(&ink_e2e::bob(), &get).dry_run().await; assert!(matches!(get_res.return_value(), false)); Extra gas margin​ As part of #1917 we added the possibility to specify a gas margin (in percentage) as part of the on-chain call. There are cases when gas estimates may not necessarily be accurate enough due to the complexity of the smart contract logic that adds additional overhead and gas consumption. Therefore, it is helpful to allow to specify an extra portion of the gas to be added to the limit (i.e. 5%, 10%). The method .extra_gas_portion(margin: u64) method is part of the builder API: ink_e2e::InstantiateBuilder::extra_gas_portion ink_e2e::CallBuilder::extra_gas_portion Improved call() API​ We removed the build_message() function with its unhandy callback. // Previously let first_insert = ink_e2e::build_message::<MappingsRef>(contract_id) .call(|contract| contract.insert_balance(1_000)); // Now let first_insert = ink_e2e::build_message::<MappingsRef>(contract_id) .call().insert_balance(1_000)); See #1782 for more details. Removed additional_contracts parameter​ additional_contracts parameter which is part of #[ink_e2e:test] has been removed in #2098. This information is now implied from the contract's manifest. Simply, add the other contract as dependency with the ink-as-a-dependency feature enabled. The test will detect the contract and build it as part of the test. New Data Structure: StorageVec​ We've added a Vec-like data structure, built on top of Mapping. This allows to retrieve elements from a vector and grow it without having to load and push all elements. For Vec, the cost of reading or writing a single element grows linearly corresponding to the number of elements in the vector (its length). Additionally, the maximum capacity of the whole vector is limited by the size of ink!'s static buffer used during ABI encoding and decoding (default 16 KiB). StorageVec on the other hand allows to access each element individually. With a Vec it's possible to e.g. introduce a security issue in your contract where an attacker can fill the Vec, making it very costly for other users to access it or write to it. You can find verbatim documentation on StorageVec here. The page explains when to use StorageVec and when not. The Rust docs can be found here. Fallible methods for Lazy, Mapping, StorageVec​ In #1910 we added try_* methods for reading and writing Lazy and Mapping values to and from storage. The try methods correspond to Mapping::{insert, get, take}, Lazy::{set, get}. For StorageVec::{peek, get, set, pop, push} we added try_* methods in #1995. Please see the individual Rust docs for these new methods: StorageVec Lazy Mapping. For Mapping, the encoded size of the key is also accounted for. You should use the try_* methods for dynamically sized values, unless you made sure otherwise they will fit into the static buffer. The static buffer in ink! is 16 kB by default. We added a lint to cargo-contract 4.0 that will detect potentially unsafe uses of methods for which there are safer alternatives: non_fallible_api. Chain Extension API changed + Support for multiple chain extensions​ With #1958 we added support for interacting with multiple chain extensions from ink!. This is a breaking change. You can now e.g. have a contract that utilizes a PSP22 chain extension together with one for random numbers. The syntax for chain extension functions changed slightly: -#[ink(extension = 0xfecb)] +#[ink(function = 0xfecb)] fn foo() {} The argument type changed from u32 to u16: -/// `#[ink(extension = N: u32)]` -Extension, +/// `#[ink(function = N: u16)]` +Function, The top level macro #[ink::chain_extension] now requires an (extension = N: u16) argument to support multiple chain extensions. If you are using only one extension, the ID can be any u16 number, otherwise please consult the #[ink::chain_extension] macro documentation -#[ink::chain_extension] +#[ink::chain_extension(extension = 1)] If the chain extension was not used in a tuple in the runtime configuration, extension = N: u16 can take any u16 number. A migration in most cases should just be to rename #[ink(extension = …)] to #[ink(function = …)], and specifying extension argument in top level macro. We added an example contract that illustrates the usage of multiple chain extensions in one contract: combined-extension. Metadata Changes​ Events 2.0​ See #1827 for the full details. Two fields werere added to the objects in the events array: module_path and signature_topic. Previously the order of the events in the events array was significant (i.e. the first one had an implied index of 0), and this index could be used to determine which event to decode. Now that is replaced by the signature_topic, and the order of the events in the metadata no longer has any significance. See the section \"Events 2.0\" on this page for more info. ink! 4.0: \"events\": [ { \"args\": [ ... ], \"docs\": [ ... ], \"label\": \"Transfer\" }, ... ] ink! 5.0: \"events\": [ { \"args\": [ ... ], \"docs\": [ ... ], \"label\": \"...\", + \"module_path\": \"erc20::erc20\", + \"signature_topic\": \"0xb5b61a3e6a21a16be4f044b517c28ac692492f73c5bfd3f60178ad98c767f4cb\" }, ... ] New field: staticBufferSize​ With #1880 we added a \"staticBufferSize\" field to the metadata file. The unit is bytes. See the section \"Buffer size can be customized\" on this page for more info. Example: \"maxEventTopics\": 4, + \"staticBufferSize\": 16384, \"timestamp\": { ... } Metadata storage keys encoding change​ Storage keys used to access storage data are SCALE encoded. Previously, the contract metadata used big endian encoding to represent storage keys. With the ink! 5.0 release, these encoding formats have been aligned, and SCALE encoding (little endian) is now used for the metadata storage keys. This is a breaking change, and client tools that use the storage keys from contract metadata will need to adapt accordingly. Please see: #2048 for details. Example: \"storage\": { \"root\": { \"layout\": { \"struct\": { \"fields\": [ { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { - \"key\": \"0x00000159\", + \"key\": \"0x59010000\", \"ty\": 0 } }, \"name\": \"value\" } ], \"name\": \"Flipper\" } }, - \"root_key\": \"0x00000159\", + \"root_key\": \"0x59010000\", \"ty\": 1 } }, Interesting New Features​ End-To-End testing with a chain snapshot​ With ink! 5.0 we introduce the possibility of running your tests against the fork (i.e. snapshot) of a live chain. See this page in our documentation for details. New lints​ The new lints are: no_main: enforces no_main for contracts. primitive_topic: no number types are allowed as event topics. storage_never_freed: what is written into storage can be removed again. strict_balance_equality: detects usage of strict balance equality checks, a common smart contract vulnerability. non_fallible_api: detects the usage of potentially unsafe methods for which there are safer alternatives. With cargo-contract 4.0 we added a couple new lints for common smart contract issues and best practices. You can run the linter via cargo contract build --lint. Details on each lint can be found here. New cargo-contract commands​ We added a bunch of helpful new commands to cargo-contract 4.0. For all these commands you can also supply the --help cli flag to get more info (e.g. cargo contract storage --help). cargo contract verify: contract verification (#1404, #1306) cargo contract info now outputs the language of the deployed contract, using a heuristic (#1329) cargo contract info --binary: outputs the on-chain Wasm of the contract (#1311) cargo contract info --all: displays all addresses of deployed contracts on a particular chain (#1319) cargo contract storage: displays the storage of an on-chain contract (#1395, #1414) Alternative off-chain E2E testing backend support: DRink!​ DRink! is a toolbox for ink! developers that allows for testing your contracts without any running node. It has a number of features that are pretty great: deploy and call your contracts synchronously, without any delays related to block production or networking. enhanced debugging and call tracing. supports arbitrary runtime configurations, including custom chain extensions and runtime calls. full control over runtime state, including block number, timestamp, etc. See the DRink! page for more details. Contract Verification​ We added a bunch of helpful documentation and cargo-contract commands for contract verification. Read more here. We improved the contract example illustrating upgradeable contracts via delegate_call​ See here for the contract example. We made set_code_hash generic​ The self.env().set_code_hash() method now accepts the Hash environment type instead of a concrete [u8; 32]. // Previously pub fn set_code(&mut self, code_hash: [u8; 32]) { ink::env::set_code_hash(&code_hash).unwrap_or_else(|err| {}); } // Now pub fn set_code(&mut self, code_hash: Hash) { self.env().set_code_hash(&code_hash).unwrap_or_else(|err| {}); } More details in #1906. Buffer size can be customized​ With #1869 we added a possibility of setting a custom static buffer size for ink! to use. ink! uses a static buffer for interacting with pallet-contracts, i.e. to move data between pallet-contracts and a smart contract. The advantage of a static buffer is that no gas-expensive heap allocations are necessary, all allocations are done using simple pointer arithmetic. The default static buffer size is 16 kB, which is enough for on-chain smart contracts. However, the Phala Network parachain on Polkadot allows the deployment of ink! contracts off-chain. Hence, for their chain certain high computation contracts might require a larger buffer size. Stabilized call_runtime​ We stabilized call_runtime in #1749. It can be used to call a runtime dispatchable from an ink! contract. You can find a contract example and a comparison with chain extensions here. We've added an example of how to end-to-end test call_runtime here. call_v2​ There is a new host function call_v2 which allows passing both Weight parts: ref_time_limit and proof_time_limit and the storage_deposit_limit. The legacy call function only provides the single gas_limit parameter, which is used as the value for ref_time_limit.

It is based on existing tools like cargo contract CLI and polkadot.js but extends their functionality with many additional features such as smart contract templates, and an instant finality (Swanky) node, which reduces the contract development lifecycle. Swanky Suite is a tool that provides Web3 Wasm dapps developers with an experience that is more in-line with what they're familiar with, compared to popular tooling for EVM. Swanky Suite offers an extensible set of features, allowing developers to: Quickly spin up a local contract development node with instant finality (Swanky Node). Easily scaffold new projects using templates for both smart contracts and (soon) front-end dApps. Compile projects in various languages that target Wasm (ink! Ask-Lite). provide Typescript based integration testing simulating interaction from the client-side. Handle and manage network accounts. Deploy smart contracts within the Polkadot ecosystem to networks that support pallet-contracts. Make arbitrary calls to deployed smart contracts. Architecture Overview​ The Swanky Suite consists of two parts, Swanky CLI and Swanky Node. Source code for both Swanky CLI and Swanky Node are hosted on GitHub: Swanky CLI. Swanky Node. The architecture envisioned for Swanky CLI and Swanky Node (Local developer node) note The actual state deviates slightly from the above diagram as both the cli and the node are constantly iterated upon and updated, but it illustrates the general idea behind the suite.

It provides standard contracts based on Polkadot Standard Proposals (PSPs), as well as higher-level contracts and Rust macros that generate ink! code. Using OpenBrush is simple, you only add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file. You can find an example here. Which standards and contract components does it contain?​ PSP22: Fungible Token (ERC20 equivalent) with extensions. PSP34: Non-Fungible Token (ERC721 equivalent) with extensions. PSP37: ERC1155 equivalent with extensions. Ownable Restrict access to action for non-owners. Access Control: Define a set of roles and restrict access to an action by roles. Reentrancy Guard: Prevent reentrant calls to a function. Pausable: Pause/Unpause the contract to disable/enable some operations. Timelock Controller: Execute transactions with some delay. Payment Splitter: Split the amount of native tokens between participants. Generic Trait Implementation​ OpenBrush adds support for generic Trait implementations, so that you can split a Trait and its implementation into different files. This can increase the readability and maintainability of your smart-contract code base (detailed description). Wrapper around Traits: #[openbrush::wrapper]​ If you know that the other contract implements a trait and the trait is attributed with #[openbrush::trait_definition] you only need that trait definition and the address of the other contract in order to call a method from the deployed third-party contract. The wrapper is an attribute macro named #[openbrush::wrapper] for traits. It will generate a callable structure of the other contract with the name defined by a user: // You can create wrapper in the place where you defined the trait // Or if you import **everything** from the file where you define trait #[openbrush::wrapper] type Trait1Ref = dyn Trait1; The benefits of such mechanism is a functional polymorphism. Instead of working with the concrete implementation of the trait as a dependency in you contract, you only interact with its interface. That means that you do not need to import other contracts as dependencies to the calling contract. If you need to update the implementation of the trait within the calling contract, you only need to replace the called contract address. The wrapper does not guarantee that the given address refers to a contract that implements the given trait. Additionally, the wrapper supports multiple traits (i.e. dyn Erc20 + Ownable + Erc721) without losing the syntax highlighting from your favourite IDE. See this example for more information.

Typechain-Polkadot is used to generate Typescript wrappers around your smart contract. This can be used for UI development or in integration tests of your ink! smart contracts. The library uses polkadot-js/api under the hood, but is especially useful because all calls and queries are typed, therefore the chance of getting some error during a call is mitigated.

It is an opinionated language that we have built by extending the popular Rust programming language with functionality needed to make it smart contract compatible. How does ink! tie into Substrate?​ Substrate is a framework for building blockchains – those can be standalone blockchains or blockchains connected to Kusama or Polkadot, so called parachains. Substrate contains a number of modules, in Substrate terminology those are called pallets. Substrate comes with a set of pallets for many requirements modern blockchains typically have – staking, fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, governance, etc. Substrate also ships with a module for smart contracts, this module is called pallet-contracts. If a parachain is developed in Substrate it can easily add smart contract functionality by including this pallet. How does ink! come into play here? ink! is a programming language, specifically it is an embedded domain-specific language for the popular Rust programming language. This means that you can use all the normal Rust syntax plus some specifics that we added to make the language suitable for the smart contract world. The pallet-contracts takes these ink! contracts and executes them safely. So in short: with ink! you can write smart contracts in Rust for blockchains built with Substrate that include pallet-contracts. How does the pallet-contracts work?​ We intentionally designed pallet-contracts in a way that it is decoupled from the language that is used to write smart contracts. The pallet is only the execution environment and it takes WebAssembly files as input. Smart contracts for this pallet have to be compiled to the WebAssembly (Wasm) target architecture. For contract developers this means they can use ink! for writing smart contracts, but can also decide on other languages. Right now three languages to choose from exist: Parity's ink! for Rust. ask! for AssemblyScript. The Solang compiler for Solidity. It's not hard to add new languages. There just needs to be a compiler for the language down to WebAssembly, then it's possible to implement the API of pallet-contracts. This API at the moment consists of about 50 functions for anything a smart contract may desire: storage access, cryptographic functionality, environmental information like block numbers, access to functions for getting random numbers or self-terminate the contract, etc. Not all of those have to be implemented in the language ‒ the ink! \"Hello, World!\" requires just six API functions. The following schema depicts this relationship: We think this design is more future-proof than some architectures found in competing ecosystems. There is no tight coupling between language and execution environment. WebAssembly is an industry standard and a multitude of programming languages can nowadays be compiled down to WebAssembly. If in, say ten years time, researchers come up with an innovative language for writing smart contracts (or a subset of an existing language) then as long as there is a WebAssembly compiler it will be easy to make this language compatible with pallet-contracts. Why include pallet-contracts on a parachain?​ There are a couple use cases for including smart contract functionality on a parachain. We distinguish three big ones. Use Case 1: Smart Contracts as \"first-class citizens\"​ The most obvious use case is a parachain which provides smart contracts as a “first-class citizen”, meaning smart contracts are the central value proposition of the chain. Those chains typically take the off-the-shelf pallet-contracts and create some additional innovation on top of it. Examples of this are: Astar: a parachain team that has built a layer on top of pallet-contracts so that contract developers can earn a passive income whenever their contracts are being used. Phala: a parachain team that utilizes pallet-contracts in a trusted execution environment, enabling confidential smart contract execution and interoperability. Aleph Zero: uses the pallet-contracts in a zero-knowledge context. t3rn: uses pallet-contracts as a building block to enable multi-chain execution for smart contracts. Use Case 2: Smart Contracts as \"second-class citizens\"​ There is another not so obvious use case for pallet-contracts: smart contracts as “second-class citizens” on an existing chain. By this we mean that the central value proposition of the chain has nothing to do with smart contracts, but it still includes them as an add-on. We provide an API (called chain extensions) with which a parachain can expose certain parts of its business logic to smart contract developers. Through this, smart contract developers can utilize the business logic primitives of the chain to build a new application on top of it. Think for example of a decentralized exchange blockchain. This chain would in its simplest form have an order book to place bids and asks ‒ there is no need for taking untrusted, Turing-complete, programs from the outside. The parachain could decide to expose the order book into smart contracts though, giving external developers the option of building new applications that utilize the order book. For example, to upload trading algorithms as smart contracts to the chain. Smart contracts here are an opportunity to up the user engagement and drive usage of the chain's native token. And the billing for utilizing the chain comes already built-in with the pallet ‒ users have to pay gas fees for the execution of their smart contract. Use Case 3: Smart Contracts as a first step into Polkadot or Kusama​ A third big use case for pallet-contracts is to prototype an idea as a proof-of-concept smart contract before leasing a dedicated parachain slot on Polkadot or Kusama. The time to develop a smart contract and deploy it is shorter than the onboarding story for a parachain. One can deploy a proof-of-concept smart contract first, see if it gains traction and the idea holds up to the real world. Only subsequently, once there is a need for e.g. cheaper transaction fees, more efficient execution, or a governance mechanism for the community, the smart contract could be migrated to a dedicated parachain runtime with its own slot. ink! contracts and Substrate runtimes are both written in Rust and share similar primitives, this enables a clear path to graduate from a smart contract to its own runtime. Developers can reuse large parts of their code, their tests, as well as frontend and client code. Smart Contracts vs. Parachains​ One of the first questions we typically get when somebody learns about Substrate, Polkadot, or Kusama is when to develop a parachain vs. when to develop a smart contract. The distinction here is that in the context of Polkadot and Kusama a parachain leases a slot for a couple of months for up to two years. The deal with a lease is that the parachain gets a fixed slot for executing its business logic (typically referred to as its state transition function) and can persist its modified state in a block. In Substrate terminology this state transition function is called the chain's runtime. The distinction to other ecosystems here is that, in the context of Polkadot, parachains and smart contracts exist at different layers of the stack: smart contracts sit on top of parachains. Parachains would usually be described as layer-1 blockchains ‒ except for that they don't have to build their own security, are upgradable, and interoperable. It's noteworthy that a parachain's state transition function doesn't get further validated ‒ it's up to the parachain how it utilizes its slot time. The parachain already pre-paid for its slot when it won the slot auction on Polkadot or Kusama. This means the parachain can build its own (blockchain) world! For example, it can decide on how transaction fees are charged ‒ or even if transaction fees are charged at all. These options are crucial when building new or more user-friendly business models. Other distinguishing factors between parachains that we observe in the wild are differences in how governance works or the crypto-economics. There are some constraints on how the parachain can build its world though. Like physics in the real world it has to adhere to certain ground rules. For Polkadot and Kusama that's for example the consensus algorithm for the Relay Chain to communicate with the parachain. From those ground rules the advantages of Polkadot and Kusama emerge. Advantages like the aforementioned shared security, cross-chain communication, or guaranteed execution slot time. For smart contracts, on the other hand, an existing parachain has to include the pallet-contracts for users to deploy smart contracts. The deployed smart contract is always untrusted code. Anyone (or any program) that has tokens of the chain can upload a smart contract without requiring permission. Smart contracts allow permissionless deployment of untrusted programs on a blockchain. The pallet-contracts has to assume that these programs are adversarial, it has to put a number of safety pillars in place to ensure that the contract can not e.g. stall the chain or cause state corruption of other contracts. For pallet-contracts those safety pillars include mechanisms like gas metering or deposits for storing data on-chain. To restate this important distinction: developing a parachain runtime is different from developing a smart contract ‒ a smart contract sits on top of a parachain. The trade-off is that with a parachain one has the freedom to decide on (nearly) all the rules that make up the parachain. With a smart contract one is constrained by what the chain allows and the safety pillars that necessarily have to be in place. A smart contract can never be as fast as a native pallet built in the parachain runtime ‒ there is too much logic in between. A smart contract on the other hand has less friction for developing and deploying it. Developers don't have to take care of governance, crypto-economics, etc. One just needs a few tokens and can go on its merry way deploying a smart contract. It's as simple as that.

Installation​ Download Binary​ The easiest method of installation is by downloading and executing a precompiled binary from the Release Page Build Locally​ If you would like to build the source locally, you should first complete the basic Rust setup instructions. Once Rust is installed and configured, you will be able to build the node with: cargo build --release Embedded Docs :book:​ Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands: ./target/release/swanky-node -h Usage​ This command will start the single-node development chain with a persistent state. ./target/release/swanky-node If you would prefer to run the node in non-persistent mode, use tmp option. ./target/release/swanky-node --tmp # or ./target/release/swanky-node --dev Purge the development chain's state. ./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain Development Accounts​ The alice development account will be the authority and sudo account as declared in the genesis state. While at the same time, the following accounts will be pre-funded: Alice Bob Charlie Dave Eve Ferdie Alice//stash Bob//stash Charlie//stash Dave//stash Eve//stash Ferdie//stash Show only Errors and Contract Debug Output​ To print errors and contract debug output to the console log, supply -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug when starting the node. ./target/release/swanky-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug Important: Debug output is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests ‒ not for transactions. See the ink! FAQ for more details: How do I print something to the console from the runtime?. Connect with Polkadot.js Apps Portal​ Once the Swanky Node is running locally, you will be able to connect to it from the Polkadot-JS Apps front-end, in order to interact with your chain. Click here connecting the Apps to your local Swanky Node. Run in Docker​ First, install Docker and Docker Compose. Then run the following command to start a single node development chain. mkdir .local # this is mounted by container ./scripts/docker_run.sh This command will compile the code, and then start a local development network. You can also replace the default command (cargo build --release && ./target/release/swanky-node --dev --ws-external) by appending your own. A few useful commands are shown below: # Run Substrate node without re-compiling ./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node --ws-external # Purge the local dev chain ./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain # Check whether the code is compilable ./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check Consensus (Manual Seal & Instant Seal)​ Unlike other blockchains, Swanky Node adopts block authoring and finality gadgets referred to as Manual Seal and Instant Seal, consensus mechanisms suitable for contract development and testing. Manual seal - Blocks are authored whenever RPC is called. Instant seal - Blocks are authored as soon as transactions enter the pool, most often resulting in one transaction per block. Swanky Node enables both Manual seal and Instant seal. Manual Sealing via RPC call​ We can tell the node to author a block by calling the engine_createBlock RPC. $ curl http://localhost:9933 -H \"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\":\"engine_createBlock\", \"params\": [true, false, null] }' Params​ Create Empty create_empty is a Boolean value indicating whether empty blocks may be created. Setting create-empty to true does not mean that an empty block will necessarily be created. Rather, it means that the engine should go ahead creating a block even if no transactions are present. If transactions are present in the queue, they will be included regardless of the value of create_empty. Finalize finalize is a Boolean value indicating whether the block (and its ancestors, recursively) should be finalized after creation. Parent Hash parent_hash is an optional hash of a block to use as a parent. To set the parent, use the format \"0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764\". To omit the parent, use null. When the parent is omitted the block will be built on the current best block. Manually specifying the parent is useful for constructing fork scenarios, and demonstrating chain reorganizations. Finalizing Blocks Manually​ In addition to finalizing blocks at the time of creating them, they may also be finalized later by using the RPC call engine_finalizeBlock. $ curl http://localhost:9933 -H \"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\":\"engine_finalizeBlock\", \"params\": [\"0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764\", null] }' Edit this page Previous Swanky CLI Next ink!

Architecture​ CosmWasm is modular, meaning that any blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can add smart contract support to their chain. That is similar to the Substrate approach, where chains have the option to add pallet-contracts to their runtime. Aside from that, the architecture philosophy is likely the point where CosmWasm and ink! differ the most. CosmWasm follows the actor model design pattern, while ink! follows a synchronous execution model. That means some fundamental differences in how the source code is structured. The main entry point functions of CosmWasm contracts are: instantiate which bootstraps the initial contract state (assuming it's already been deployed). execute which has the actor perform operations to its internal state. query which retrieves data from the actor’s internal state. An ink! contract can have as many public dispatchables as the developer desires, and differently from CosmWasm, it doesn’t rely on JSON schemas for defining how the messages are structured. Instead, ink! makes heavy usage of Rust macros. The main ink! macros are: #[ink(constructor)] which is called when the contract is deployed, and is responsible for bootstrapping the initial contract state into the storage. It is analogous to the CosmWasm instantiate function. #[ink(storage)] which annotates a struct that represents the contract's internal state. #[ink(message)] which marks a function as a public dispatchable, meaning that it is exposed in the contract interface to the outside world. This macro can make a function behave analogously to CosmWasm’s execute and query functions. This depends on how it affects the internal contract state and what the return types. #[ink(event)] and #[ink(topic)] which annotates a struct and its members as the events and topics that the contract might emit. There are other ink! macros, for which details can be found at Macros & Attributes. Unit Testing​ Unit testing in CosmWasm is quite similar to ink!. Both use the conventional Rust #[cfg(test)] macro and set up a mock on-chain environment. While CosmWasm unit tests have different modules for each of the three main entry-point functions, ink! allows for a more generalised approach, where the #[ink(test)] macro is used for each unit test. You can read more about ink! unit tests here. Compiler​ CosmWasm uses cargo-wasm as its main compiler, while ink! uses cargo-contract. cargo-contract is developed by Parity specifically for building, testing, and deploying ink! contracts. Local Development Network In terms of local development networks, the cosmos/gaia repository acts as the basic template for a generic Cosmos node. With the addition of the x/wasm module and some clean-up, this template repository becomes wasmd, the entry point for CosmWasm development. In terms of Substrate, substrate-node-template is a basic generic template of a node. Similar to x/wasm, pallet-contracts is the module that adds WebAssembly smart contract functionality to the chain. Parity provides the substrate-contracts-node, which is analogous to wasmd - a basic template node for smart contract development. Testnets​ For CosmWasm development and on-chain testing, wasmd can be operated as a local setup (single or multiple nodes), or connected to the cliffnet public test network. ink! contracts can be deployed on a few different options: Locally, on a single or multiple node setup of substrate-contracts-node. Contracts on Rococo Parachain, which is connected to the Rococo relay chain test network. Astar Network’s Shibuya testnet. Development Workflow​ Dependencies​ The first step in CosmWasm development is to install dependencies, namely Go, Rust and wasmd. For ink! you can also find a setup guide which will help you with dependencies, namely Rust, cargo-contract and substrate-contracts-node. Environment Setup​ The next step in the CosmWasm development workflow is setting up the environment. That consists mainly of configuring wasmd such that it has prefunded accounts that are able to interact with the network. When substrate-contracts-node is started, it already contains well known pre-funded accounts (alice, bob, etc.) which are ready to be used for development. Compile and Test​ CosmWasm provides example contracts at the cw-contracts repository. After the repository is cloned, from the contract directory it can be compiled via: $ cargo wasm and tested via: $ cargo unit-test Similarly, ink! provides an examples directory of its main repository. A contract can be compiled from its directory via: $ cargo contract build and tested via: $ cargo test Deploy and Interact​ CosmWasm contracts are deployed and instantiated with help of the wasmd executable. The list of step is provided here. It is possible to deploy and interact with ink! contracts using either a CLI (cargo-contract), or a web UI (contracts-ui).

Installation​ The linter is integrated to the contracts build process, therefore you should already have it installed if you are using cargo-contract of version 4.0.0 or later. The linter requires two crates and a fixed Rust toolchain version. You can use these commands to install the required dependencies: rustup install nightly-2023-12-28 cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link Note that the linter requires this specific version of the toolchain, since it uses the internal compiler API. Usage​ The linter operates via cargo-contract. By default, the linter is executed only for the RISC-V target, while for the WASM target, it is not executed unless specifically requested by the user. To perform a build with extra code analysis, run the following command within the contract directory: cargo contract build --lint This command compiles the contract and applies all linting checks.

Example​ // Bad // It typically makes no sense to filter `Balance`, since its value may varies from `::MAX` // to `::MIN`. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transaction { #[ink(topic)] src: Option<AccountId>, #[ink(topic)] dst: Option<AccountId>, #[ink(topic)] value: Balance, } Use instead: // Good // Filtering transactions based on source and destination addresses. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transaction { #[ink(topic)] src: Option<AccountId>, #[ink(topic)] dst: Option<AccountId>, value: Balance, } Edit this page Previous no_main Next storage_never_freed What it does Why is this bad?

Why is this bad?​ When a user executes a contract function that writes to storage, they have to put a deposit down for the amount of storage space used. Whoever frees up that storage at some later point gets the deposit back. Therefore, it is always a good idea to make it possible for users to free up their storage space. Example​ In the following example there is a storage field with the Mapping type that has an function that inserts new elements: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Transaction { values: Mapping<AccountId, AccountId>, } fn add_value(&mut self, k: &AccountId, v: &AccountId) { // ... self.values.insert(k, v); // ... } But, ideally, there also should be a function that allows the user to remove elements from the Mapping freeing storage space: fn del_value(&mut self, k: &AccountId) { // ... self.values.remove(k); // ... } Edit this page Previous primitive_topic Next strict_balance_equality What it does Why is this bad?

Why is this bad?​ In some standard collections in ink!, there are two types of implementations: non-fallible (e.g. get) and fallible (e.g. try_get). Fallible alternatives are considered safer, as they perform additional checks for incorrect input parameters and return Result::Err when they are used improperly. On the other hand, non-fallible methods do not provide these checks and will panic on incorrect input, placing the responsibility on the user to implement these checks. For more context, see: ink#1910. Example​ Consider the contract that has the following Mapping field: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Example { map: Mapping<String, AccountId> } The following usage of the non-fallible API is unsafe: // Bad: can panic if `input_string` doesn't fit into the static buffer self.map.insert(input_string, &self.sender); It could be replaced with the fallible version of Mapping::insert: // Good: returns Result::Err on incorrect input self.map.try_insert(input_string, &self.sender); Otherwise, the user could explicitly check the encoded size of the argument in their code: // Good: explicitly checked encoded size of the input if String::encoded_size(&input_string) < ink_env::BUFFER_SIZE { self.map.insert(input_string, &self.sender); } Edit this page Previous strict_balance_equality Next Overview What it does Why is this bad?

Why is this bad?​ The problem with strict balance equality is that it is always possible to forcibly send tokens to a contract. For example, using terminate_contract. In such a case, the condition involving the contract balance will work incorrectly, what may lead to security issues, including DoS attacks and draining contract's gas. Known problems​ There are many ways to implement balance comparison in ink! contracts. This lint is not trying to be exhaustive. Instead, it addresses the most common cases that may occur in real-world contracts and focuses on precision and lack of false positives. Example​ Assume, there is an attacker contract that sends all its funds to the target contract when terminated: #[ink::contract] pub mod attacker { // ... #[ink(message)] pub fn attack(&mut self, target: &AccountId) { self.env().terminate_contract(target); } } If the target contains a condition with strict balance equality, this may be manipulated by the attacker: #[ink::contract] pub mod target { // ... #[ink(message)] pub fn do_something(&mut self) { if self.env().balance() != 100 { // Bad: Strict balance equality // ... some logic } } } This could be mitigated using non-strict equality operators in the condition with the balance: #[ink::contract] pub mod target { // ... #[ink(message)] pub fn do_something(&mut self) { if self.env().balance() < 100 { // Good: Non-strict equality // ... some logic } } } Edit this page Previous storage_never_freed Next non_fallible_api What it does Why is this bad?

This is especially useful for user defined events. The signature of the event is by default one of the topics of the event, except if you annotate the event with #[ink(anonymous)].

If you are a beginner trying to learn ink! we recommend you to check out our extensive ink! workshop. Description​ The macro does analysis on the provided smart contract code and generates proper code. Usage​ Header Arguments​ The #[ink::contract] macro can be provided with some additional comma-separated header arguments: compile_as_dependency: bool​ Tells the ink! code generator to always or never compile the smart contract as if it was used as a dependency of another ink! smart contract. Normally this flag is only really useful for ink! developers who want to inspect code generation of ink! smart contracts. The author is not aware of any particular practical use case for users that makes use of this flag but contract writers are encouraged to disprove this. Note that it is recommended to make use of the built-in crate feature ink-as-dependency to flag smart contract dependencies listed in a contract's Cargo.toml as actual dependencies to ink!. Usage Example: #[ink::contract(compile_as_dependency = true)] mod my_contract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyStorage; impl MyStorage { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { MyStorage {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } // ... } Default value: Depends on the crate feature propagation of Cargo.toml. env: impl Environment​ Tells the ink! code generator which environment to use for the ink! smart contract. The environment must implement the Environment (defined in ink_env) trait and provides all the necessary fundamental type definitions for Balance, AccountId etc. When using a custom Environment implementation for a smart contract all types that it exposes to the ink! smart contract and the mirrored types used in the runtime must be aligned with respect to SCALE encoding and semantics. Usage Example: Given a custom Environment implementation: pub struct MyEnvironment; impl ink::env::Environment for MyEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 3; type AccountId = u64; type Balance = u128; type Hash = [u8; 32]; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = ::ink::env::NoChainExtension; } A user might implement their ink! smart contract using the above custom Environment implementation as demonstrated below: #[ink::contract(env = MyEnvironment)] mod my_contract { pub struct MyEnvironment; impl ink::env::Environment for MyEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 3; type AccountId = u64; type Balance = u128; type Hash = [u8; 32]; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = ::ink::env::NoChainExtension; } #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyStorage; impl MyStorage { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { MyStorage {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } // ... } Default value: DefaultEnvironment defined in ink_env crate. Analysis​ The #[ink::contract] macro fully analyses its input smart contract against invalid arguments and structure. Some example rules include but are not limited to: There must be exactly one #[ink(storage)] struct. This struct defines the layout of the storage that the ink! smart contract operates on. The user is able to use a variety of built-in facilities, combine them in various ways or even provide their own implementations of storage data structures. For more information visit the ink_storage crate documentation. Example: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } } There must be at least one #[ink(constructor)] defined method. Methods flagged with #[ink(constructor)] are special in that they are dispatchable upon contract instantiation. A contract may define multiple such constructors which allow users of the contract to instantiate a contract in multiple different ways. Example: Given the Flipper contract definition above we add an #[ink(constructor)] as follows: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } } There must be at least one #[ink(message)] defined method. Methods flagged with #[ink(message)] are special in that they are dispatchable upon contract invocation. The set of ink! messages defined for an ink! smart contract define its API surface with which users are allowed to interact. An ink! smart contract can have multiple such ink! messages defined. Note: An ink! message with a &self receiver may only read state whereas an ink! message with a &mut self receiver may mutate the contract's storage. Example: Given the Flipper contract definition above we add some #[ink(message)] definitions as follows: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Payable Messages: An ink! message by default will reject calls that additional fund the smart contract. Authors of ink! smart contracts can make an ink! message payable by adding the payable flag to it. An example below: Note that ink! constructors are always implicitly payable and thus cannot be flagged as such. #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] #[ink(payable)] // You can either specify payable out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message, payable)] // ...or specify payable inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Controlling the messages selector: Every ink! message and ink! constructor has a unique selector with which the message or constructor can be uniquely identified within the ink! smart contract. These selectors are mainly used to drive the contract's dispatch upon calling it. An ink! smart contract author can control the selector of an ink! message or ink! constructor using the selector flag. An example is shown below: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] #[ink(selector = \"0xDEADBEEF\")] // Works on constructors as well. pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] #[ink(selector = \"0xCAFEBABE\")] // You can either specify selector out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message, selector = \"0xFEEDBEEF\")] // ...or specify selector inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Interacting with the Contract Executor​ The ink_env crate provides facilities to interact with the contract executor that connects ink! smart contracts with the outer world. For example it is possible to query the current call's caller via: use ink_env; ink::env::test::run_test::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment, _>(|_| { let caller = ink::env::caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); let _caller = caller; Ok(()) }).unwrap(); However, ink! provides a much simpler way to interact with the contract executor via its environment accessor. An example below: #[ink::contract] mod greeter { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Greeter; impl Greeter { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); let message = format!(\"thanks for instantiation {:?}\", caller); ink::env::debug_println(&message); Greeter {} } #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn fund(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let value = self.env().transferred_balance(); let message = format!(\"thanks for the funding of {:?} from {:?}\", value, caller); ink::env::debug_println(&message); } } } Events​ An ink! smart contract may define events that it can emit during contract execution. Emitting events can be used by third party tools to query information about a contract's execution and state. The following example ink! contract shows how an event Transferred is defined and emitted in the #[ink(constructor)]. #[ink::contract] mod erc20 { /// Defines an event that is emitted every time value is transferred. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transferred { from: Option<AccountId>, to: Option<AccountId>, value: Balance, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Erc20 { total_supply: Balance, // more fields ... } impl Erc20 { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), value: initial_supply, }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply } } #[ink(message)] pub fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { self.total_supply } } } Example: Flipper​ The below code shows the complete implementation of the so-called Flipper ink! smart contract. For us it acts as the \"Hello, World!\" of the ink! smart contracts because it is minimal while still providing some more or less useful functionality. It controls a single bool value that can be either false or true and allows the user to flip this value using the Flipper::flip message or retrieve the current value using Flipper::get. #[ink::contract] pub mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { /// Creates a new flipper smart contract initialized with the given value. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(init_value: bool) -> Self { Self { value: init_value } } /// Flips the current value of the Flipper's bool. #[ink(message)] pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value of the Flipper's bool. #[ink(message)] pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Edit this page Previous Overview Next #[ink(anonymous)] Description Usage Header Arguments compile_as_dependency: bool env: impl Environment Analysis Interacting with the Contract Executor Events Example: Flipper","s":"#[ink::contract]","u":"/5.x/macros-attributes/contract","h":"","p":507},{"i":510,"t":"Macros & Attributes #[ink(default)] Version: 5.0-rc On this page Applicable to ink! messages and constructors.

Convert Solidity class fields to Rust struct​ Solidity is an object-oriented language, and uses classes. ink! (Rust) does not use classes. An example Solidity class looks like: contract MyContract { bool private _theBool; event UpdatedBool(bool indexed _theBool); constructor(bool theBool_) { require(theBool_ == true, \"theBool_ must start as true\"); _theBool = theBool_; } function setBool(bool newBool) public returns (bool boolChanged) { if _theBool == newBool { boolChanged = false; } else { boolChanged = true; } _theBool = newBool; // emit event UpdatedBool(newBool); } } And the equivalent contract in ink! looks like: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] use ink_lang as ink; #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { the_bool: bool, // class members become struct fields } #[ink(event)] pub struct UpdatedBool { #[ink(topic)] // -> indexed the_bool: bool, } impl MyContract { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(the_bool: bool) -> Self { assert!(the_bool == true, \"the_bool must start as true\"); Self { the_bool } } #[ink(message)] // functions become struct implementations pub fn set_bool(&mut self, new_bool: bool) -> bool { let bool_changed = true; if self.the_bool == new_bool{ bool_changed = false; }else{ bool_changed = true; } self.the_bool = new_bool; self.env().emit_event(UpdatedBool { the_bool: new_bool }); // return bool_changed } } } A few key differences are: Solidity class variables / members will be placed in the contract struct in ink! All class methods in Solidity are implemented for the contract struct in ink! Solidity frequently prefixes variables with an underscore (_name). ink! / Rust only prefixes with an underscore for unused variables. Solidity uses camelCase. ink! uses snake_case. In Solidity, the variable type comes before the variable name (e.g. bool myVar). While ink! specifies var type after the var name (e.g. my_var: bool) 4. Convert each function​ Start converting each function one by one. A recommended approach is to, if possible, skip cross-contract calls at first and use mock data instead This way off-chain unit tests can be written to test the core functionality unit tests are off-chain and do not work with cross-contract calls Once fully tested, start adding in cross-contract calls and perform on-chain manual + integration tests Ensure that function's visibility (public, private) are matched in ink! In Solidity, if a function returns a bool success, ink! will use a Result<()> instead (Result::Ok or Result::Err). Solidity return example: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.1; contract Example { uint128 public data; constructor(){} function setData(uint128 newData) public returns ( bool success, string memory reason ) { if (newData == 0) { return (false, \"Data should not be zero\"); } data = newData; return (true, \"\"); } } The equivalent contract in ink!: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] #[ink::contract] mod example { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Example { data: u128, } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)] pub enum Error { DataShouldNotBeZero, } pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>; impl Example { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { data: 0 } } #[ink(message)] pub fn set_data(&mut self, new_data: u128) -> Result<()> { if new_data == 0 { return Err(Error::DataShouldNotBeZero); } self.data = new_data; Ok(()) } } } Best Practices + Tips​ If the Solidity contract uses a string, it is recommended to use a Vec<u8> to avoid the overhead of a String. See here for more details on why. The smart contract should only contain the information that strictly needs to be placed on the blockchain and go through consensus. The UI should be used for displaying strings. Double check all .unwrap()s performed. Solidity does not have as strict checking as ink! does. For example, a mapping field can be accessed as simple as myMapping[someKey]. ink!, however, requires self.my_mapping.get(some_key).unwrap(). A useful way to handle None cases is to use .unwrap_or(some_val). Run the contracts node with substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug for debug prints, and errors to be displayed in the nodes console. When passing parameters to a helper, it is recommended to pass references (even for primitives) as Wasm is more efficient with references. For example (see erc20 example): /// Returns the account balance for the specified `owner`. /// /// Returns `0` if the account is non-existent. #[ink(message)] pub fn balance_of(&self, owner: AccountId) -> Balance { self.balance_of_impl(&owner) } /// Returns the account balance for the specified `owner`. /// /// Returns `0` if the account is non-existent. /// /// # Note /// /// Prefer to call this method over `balance_of` since this /// works using references which are more efficient in Wasm. #[inline] fn balance_of_impl(&self, owner: &AccountId) -> Balance { self.balances.get(owner).unwrap_or_default() } Just as in Solidity, ink! does not have floating point numbers due to the non-deterministic nature. Instead, the frontend should add decimal points as needed. Syntax Equivalencies​ public function​ // solidity function fnName() public {} // or // by default, functions are public function fnName() {} // ink! #[ink(message)] pub fn fn_name(&self) {} mapping declaration​ // solidity mapping(address => uint128) private mapName; //ink! use ink_storage::{ traits::SpreadAllocate, Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] #[derive(SpreadAllocate)] pub struct ContractName { map_name: Mapping<AccountId, u128>, } When using a map in ink!, ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract must be used in the constructor. See here for more details. mapping usage​ // solidity // insert / update aMap[aKey] = aValue; // get aMap[aKey] // ink! //insert / update self.a_map.insert(&a_key, &a_value); // get self.a_map.get(a_key).unwrap() struct​ // solidity struct MyPerson{ address person; u64 favNum; } // ink! struct MyPerson { person: AccountId, fav_num: u64, } assertions / requires​ // solidity require(someValue < 10, \"someValue is not less than 10\"); // ink! assert!(some_value < 10, \"some_value is not less than 10\"); timestamp​ // solidity block.timestamp // ink! self.env().block_timestamp() contract caller​ // solidity address caller = msg.sender; // ink! let caller: AccountId = self.env().caller(); contract's address​ // solidity address(this) // ink! self.env().account_id() bytes​ Solidity has a type bytes. bytes is (essentially) equivalent to an array of uint8. So, bytes in Solidity => Vec<u8> or [u8; ...] in ink!. See here for more details. If desired, a bytes struct can be created in ink! to replicate the bytes type in Solidity. uint256​ Solidity uses uint256 and uint to represent a 256-bit type. Solidity is 256-bit / 32-byte word optimized. Meaning, using uint256 in Solidity contracts will reduce gas usage -- but increase storage usage. The largest size ink! has built in is a u128. ink! compiles to Wasm. The largest primitive Wasm has is 64bit (due to most computers using 64bit). So, there is no benefit to using any larger primitive over a collection. When porting a uint256 from Solidity to ink!, it is recommended to, with discretion, determine the range of the value, and choose the appropriate size (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128). If a 256-bit hash value is required, ink! has a Hash primitive available. In the event a value needs to be 256-bit, it is recommended to use an array (e.g. [u64; 4]). payable​ // solidity function myFunction() payable returns (uint64) {} #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn my_function(&self) -> u64 {} received deposit / payment​ // solidity msg.value // ink! self.env().transferred_value() contract balance​ // solidity address(this).balance // ink! self.env().balance() transfer tokens from contract​ // solidity recipient.send(amount) // ink! if self.env().transfer(recipient, amount).is_err() { panic!(\"error transferring\") } events & indexed​ // solidity event MyCoolEvent( u128 indexed indexedValue, u128 notIndexedValue, ); // emit event emit MyCoolEvent(someValue, someOtherValue); // ink! #[ink(event)] pub struct MyCoolEvent { #[ink(topic)] indexed_value: u128, not_indexed_value: u128, } // emit event self.env().emit_event(MyCoolEvent { indexed_value: some_value, not_indexed_value: some_other_value }); errors and returning​ Solidity has several error handling mechanisms: assert, require, revert, and throw. Each of these will revert the changed state when called. See this article for details on these. ink! uses a Result enum (Ok(T), Err(E)), assert! and panic!. This Stack Exchange answer and GitHub discussion provide more details on these. throw​ Throw is deprecated in Solidity and would throw an invalid opcode error (no details) and revert the state. As an alternative to the if...{throw;} pattern in Solidity, a Result::Err should be returned for expected errors, and an assert! should be used for errors that should not occur. assert​ In Solidity, assert is used as internal guards against errors in the code. In general, properly functioning code should never hit a failing assert. assert in Solidity does not have error strings. In ink!, use assert!. assert! will panic! if it evaluates to false. The state will be reverted, and a CalleeTrapped will be returned. The (optional) error string will be printed to the debug buffer. // ink! assert!(caller == owner, \"caller is not owner\") require and revert​ In Solidity, require is used for general (normal) errors -- such as errors that occur based on user input. require does have the option for an error string. revert is very similar to require except that revert will be called in if ... else chains. Both require and revert will revert the chain state. In ink!, if ... { return Err(Error::SomeError) } should be used for require or revert. When a Result::Err is returned in ink!, then all state is reverted. In general, Result::Err should be used when a calling contract needs to know why a function failed. Otherwise, assert! should be used as it has less overhead than a Result. // Solidity function myFunction(bool returnError) public pure { require(!returnError, \"my error here\"); // or if returnError { revert(\"my error here\"); } } // ink! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)] #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum Error { /// Provide a detailed comment on the error MyError, } // result type pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>; // ... #[ink(message)] pub fn my_function(&self, return_error: bool) -> Result<()> { if return_error{ return Err(Error::MyError) } Ok(()) } nested mappings + custom / advanced structures​ In Solidity, it is easy to do nested mappings. It is not as straightforward in ink!. imagine the following scenario // solidity contract Dao { struct Proposal { mapping (address => bool) votedYes } mapping (address => bool) public isWhitelisted; Proposal[] public proposals; } in ink! this seems like it could be represented like so: #[ink::contract] mod dao { use ink::{ prelude::vec::Vec, storage::Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] pub struct Proposal { voted_yes: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Dao { proposals: Vec<Proposal>, is_whitelisted: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } impl Dao{ #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { is_whitelisted: Mapping::default(), proposals: Vec::new(), } } } } However, this will cause an error due to the nested mapping. This answer explains in detail why nested mappings are not allowed So, as of now, to get around this issue an alternate data structure will need to be used. A data-structure that can be interchanged with the Mapping syntax and with minimal additional implementations is the BTreeMap. BTreeMap is less efficient than Mapping, but is an easy workaround until nested mappings are allowed. This will be used in the nested struct. Additional derives will need to be added to be compatible with the #[ink(storage)] struct (see below). #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] #[ink::contract] mod dao { use ink::{ prelude::{ collections::BTreeMap, vec::Vec, }, storage::Mapping, }; #[derive(Debug)] #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub struct Proposal { voted_yes: BTreeMap<AccountId, bool>, } #[ink(storage)] #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Dao { proposals: Vec<Proposal>, is_whitelisted: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } impl Dao{ #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { is_whitelisted: Mapping::default(), proposals: Vec::new(), } } #[ink(message)] pub fn add_proposal(&mut self) { self.proposals.push(Proposal { voted_yes: BTreeMap::new(), }); } #[ink(message)] pub fn vote(&mut self, proposal_id: u32, vote: bool) { let proposal = self.proposals .get_mut(proposal_id as usize) .unwrap(); proposal.voted_yes .insert(Self::env().caller(), vote); } #[ink(message)] pub fn get_proposal(&self, proposal_id: u32) -> BTreeMap<AccountId, bool> { self.proposals .get(proposal_id as usize) .unwrap() .voted_yes .clone() } } } cross-contract calling​ In ink!, to do cross-contract calling, the contract will need to be added to the project. Ensure the contract is properly exporting its Structs. See the erc20 contract example: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] // make the structs visible pub use self::erc20::{ Erc20, // this is necessary Erc20Ref, }; #[ink::contract] pub mod erc20 {} In the new cross-called contract's Cargo.toml, add (or edit) the following: [lib] name = \"erc20\" path = \"lib.rs\" crate-type = [ # Used for normal contract Wasm blobs. \"cdylib\", # Used for ABI generation. Necessary for importing as a dependency \"rlib\", ] [features] ink-as-dependency = [] ink-as-dependency \"tells the ink! code generator to always or never compile the smart contract as if it was used as a dependency of another ink! smart contract\" (source). Then, In the main contract's Cargo.toml, import the contract that will be cross-called. erc20 = { path = \"erc20\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] } And make sure to add it to the std field of the .toml file. [features] default = [\"std\"] std = [ # ... \"erc20/std\", ] Now, import the cross-called-contract to the main contract: // example use erc20::Erc20Ref; There are two methods to setup the other contract. Instantiate the cross-called-contract in the main contract's constructor. See here for a tutorial, and here for an example. Or, add the AccountId of an already deployed contract. Here is an example constructor to set this up: use my_other_contract::MyOtherContractRef; // ... fn new(contract_id: AccountId) -> Self { // for already deployed contract let contract_ref: MyOtherContractRef = ink_env::call::FromAccountId::from_account_id(contract_id); Self {contract_ref} } Now, to perform the cross-contract call: { self.contract_ref.some_external_function(a_param); } Note: as of now (ink! v3.3.1), when using cross-contract calls, emitting events will not work and compile errors will occur. See issue #1000. Furthermore, the compiler will throw an error saying that (for example) Erc20Ref does not implement SpreadAllocate. This issue #1149 explains more and has a workaround. These issues will be fixed in issue #1134. submit generic transaction / dynamic cross-contract calling​ // solidity // invokes function found at`addr`, sends the `_amount` to the `addr`, and the `_transactionData` payload. addr.call.value(_amount)(_transactionData) // ink! // ... use ink_env::call::{ build_call, Call, ExecutionInput, Selector, }; /// A wrapper that allows us to encode a blob of bytes. /// /// We use this to pass the set of untyped (bytes) parameters to the `CallBuilder`. struct CallInput<'a>(&'a [u8]); impl<'a> scale::Encode for CallInput<'a> { fn encode_to<T: Output + ?Sized>(&self, dest: &mut T) { dest.write(self.0); } } // ... // see: https://github.com/paritytech/ink-examples/blob/main/multisig/lib.rs#L535 fn invoke_transaction( &mut self, callee: AccountId, transfer_amount: u128, function_selector: [u8; 4], transaction_data: Vec<u8>, gas_limit: u64) -> Result<()> { let result = build_call::<<Self as ::ink_lang::reflect::ContractEnv>::Env>() .call_type( Call::new() .callee(callee) // contract to call .gas_limit(*gas_limit) .transferred_value(transfer_amount), // value to transfer with call ) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::from(*function_selector)) .push_arg(CallInput(transaction_data)), // SCALE-encoded parameters ) .returns::<()>() .fire() .map_err(|_| Error::TransactionFailed); result } Note: the function_selector bytes can be found in the generated target/ink/<contract-name>.json. Limitations of ink! v3​ Multi-file projects are not supported with pure ink! implementing traits / interfaces will not work There are alternatives that do add this functionality such as OpenBrush Nested structs and data structures can be difficult to use Cross-contract calling prevents events from being emitted. See here for details. Cross-contract calling can not be tested off-chain with unit tests. On-chain integration tests will need to be used. Troubleshooting Errors​ ERROR: Validation of the Wasm failed. ERROR: Validation of the Wasm failed. ERROR: An unexpected panic function import was found in the contract Wasm. This typically goes back to a known bug in the Rust compiler: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78744 As a workaround try to insert `overflow-checks = false` into your `Cargo.toml`. This will disable safe math operations, but unfortunately we are currently not aware of a better workaround until the bug in the compiler is fixed. Solution Add the following to the contract Cargo.toml: [profile.release] overflow-checks = false \"failed to load bitcode of module '...' \" This happens when trying to import a contract for cross-contract calling. Solution Ensure that the following is added to Cargo.toml contract import:` features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] so the import would look like: mycontract = { path = \"mycontract/\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"]} unit testing (off-chain)​ Unit tests are an integral part of smart-contract development and ensuring your code works off-chain before testing on-chain. To run ink! tests, use the command cargo test. Add the --nocapture flag for debug prints to show. From the contract module, make sure to make the contract struct and anything else that is going to be used in the unit tests public. For example: // top of file #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] pub use self::mycontract::{ MyContract }; Off-chain unit tests will not work with cross-contract calls. One workaround to ensure unit tests are still passing is to provide mock data. An easy approach is to use conditional compiling with #[cfg(test)] and #[cfg(not(test))]. Note: This solution may not be the best option. A more effective approach can be found in our current E2E test. Please refer to the showcased example here. For example, here is a read-only ERC20 cross-contract call: // only compiles when *not* running tests #[cfg(not(test))] fn get_token_balance(&self, caller: &AccountId) -> Balance { // calls the external ERC-20 contract self.token.balance_of(*caller) } // only compiles when running tests #[cfg(test)] fn get_token_balance(&self, _: &AccountId) -> Balance { // arbitrary value 1 } And if the cross-contract call writes to storage, a mock field can be added to the contract struct. For example: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { #[cfg(test)] mock_field: SomeStruct, // will serve as a fake storage } ... // on-chain, performs cross-contract call #[cfg(not(test))] fn do_some_write(&mut self) { self.external_contract.write_to_field(0xDEADBEEF); } // testing environment only #[cfg(test)] fn do_some_write(&mut self) { self.mock_field.my_fake_storage_item = 0xDEADBEEF; } useful code to interact and modify the contract environment for testing ink_env docs // get the default accounts (alice, bob, ...) let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); accounts.alice //usage example // set which account calls the contract ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.bob); // get the contract's address let callee = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); // set the contracts address. // by default, this is alice's account ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(callee); // transfer native currency to the contract ink::env::test::set_value_transferred::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(2); // increase block number (and block timestamp). // this can be placed in a loop to advance the block many times ink::env::test::advance_block::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); // generate arbitrary AccountId AccountId::from([0x01; 32]); // generate arbitrary Hash Hash::from([0x01; 32]) // macro for tests that are expected to panic. #[should_panic] Edit this page Previous How it Works – Substrate Next ink! vs. CosmWasm Solidity to ink!

This API already allows a whole variety of interaction between the contracts-pallet and the executed smart contract. For example it is possible to call and instantiate other smart contracts on the same chain, emit events, query context information or run built-in cryptographic hashing procedures. If this basic set of features is not enough for a particular Substrate built blockchain it is possible to easily extend this API using the so-called chain extension feature. With chain extensions you can expose parts of your runtime logic to smart contract developers. note The ink! examples repository contains the rand-extension example. This is a complete example of a chain extension implemented in both ink! and Substrate. Structure​ The interface consists of an error code that indicates lightweight errors as well as the definition of some chain extension methods. The overall structure follows that of a simple Rust trait definition. The error code is defined as an associated type definition of the trait definition. The methods are defined as associated trait methods without implementation. Chain extension methods must not have a self receiver such as &self or &mut self and must have inputs and output that implement SCALE codec. Their return value follows specific rules that can be altered using the handle_status attribute and alternation between Result and Non-Result types which are described in more detail below. Usage​ Usually the chain extension definition using this proc. macro is provided by the author of the chain extension in a separate crate. ink! smart contracts using this chain extension simply depend on this crate and use its associated environment definition in order to make use of the methods provided by the chain extension. Macro Attributes​ The macro supports only one required argument: extension = N: u16. The runtime may have several chain extensions at the same time. The extension identifier points to the corresponding chain extension in the runtime. The value should be the same as during the definition of the chain extension. You can consult the chain extension module documentation if you are unsure how to find the chain extension code. Otherwise, you should consult the target chain's documentation for specifications of any chain extensions it exposes. If the chain extension is not used in a tuple in the runtime configuration, extension = N: u16 can take any u16 number. Method Attributes​ There are two different attributes with which the chain extension methods can be flagged: Attribute Required Default Value Description ink(function = N: u16) Yes - Determines the unique function ID within the chain extension. ink(handle_status = flag: bool) Optional true Assumes that the returned status code of the chain extension method always indicates success and therefore always loads and decodes the output buffer of the call. As with all ink! attributes multiple of them can either appear in a contiguous list: type Access = i32; #[ink::chain_extension(extension = 12)] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = i32; #[ink(function = 5, handle_status = false)] fn key_access_for_account(key: &[u8], account: &[u8]) -> Access; } …or as multiple standalone ink! attributes applied to the same item: type Access = i32; #[ink::chain_extension(extension = 12)] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = i32; #[ink(function = 5)] #[ink(handle_status = false)] fn key_access_for_account(key: &[u8], account: &[u8]) -> Access; } Details: handle_status​ Default value: true By default all chain extension methods should return a Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>. The Self::ErrorCode represents the error code of the chain extension. This means that a smart contract calling such a chain extension method first queries the returned status code of the chain extension method and only loads and decodes the output if the returned status code indicates a successful call. This design was chosen as it is more efficient when no output besides the error code is required for a chain extension call. When designing a chain extension try to utilize the error code to return errors and only use the output buffer for information that does not fit in a single u32 value. A chain extension method that is flagged with handle_status = false assumes that the returned error code will always indicate success. Therefore it will always load and decode the output buffer and loses the E: From<Self::ErrorCode constraint for the call. Note that if a chain extension method does not return Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>, but handle_status = true it will still return a value of type Result<T, Self::ErrorCode>. Usage: handle_status + Result<T, E> return type​ Use both handle_status = false and non-Result return type for the same chain extension method if a call to it may never fail and never returns a Result type. Combinations​ Due to the possibility to flag a chain extension method with handle_status and either (1) return Result<T, E> or (2) return just T there are 4 different cases with slightly varying semantics: handle_status Returns Result<T, E> Effects true true The chain extension method is required to return a value of type Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>. A call will always check if the returned status code indicates success and only then will load and decode the value in the output buffer. true false The chain extension method may return any non-Result type. A call will always check if the returned status code indicates success and only then will load and decode the value in the output buffer. The actual return type of the chain extension method is still Result<T, Self::ErrorCode> when the chain extension method was defined to return a value of type T. false true The chain extension method is required to return a value of type Result<T, E>. A call will always assume that the returned status code indicates success and therefore always load and decode the output buffer directly. false false The chain extension method may return any non-Result type. A call will always assume that the returned status code indicates success and therefore always load and decode the output buffer directly. Error Code​ Every chain extension defines exactly one ErrorCode using the following syntax: #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = MyErrorCode; // more definitions ... } The defined ErrorCode must implement FromStatusCode which should be implemented as a more or less trivial conversion from the u32 status code to a Result<(), Self::ErrorCode>. The Ok(()) value indicates that the call to the chain extension method was successful. By convention an error code of 0 represents success. However, chain extension authors may use whatever suits their needs. Example: Definition​ In the below example a chain extension is defined that allows its users to read and write from and to the runtime storage using access privileges: /// Custom chain extension to read to and write from the runtime. #[ink::chain_extension(extension = 12)] pub trait RuntimeReadWrite { type ErrorCode = ReadWriteErrorCode; /// Reads from runtime storage. /// /// # Note /// /// Actually returns a value of type `Result<Vec<u8>, Self::ErrorCode>`. #[ink(function = 1, returns_result = false)] fn read(key: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>; /// /// Reads from runtime storage. /// /// Returns the number of bytes read and up to 32 bytes of the /// read value. Unused bytes in the output are set to 0. /// /// # Errors /// /// If the runtime storage cell stores a value that requires more than /// 32 bytes. /// /// # Note /// /// This requires `ReadWriteError` to implement `From<ReadWriteErrorCode>` /// and may potentially return any `Self::ErrorCode` through its return value. #[ink(function = 2)] fn read_small(key: &[u8]) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError>; /// Writes into runtime storage. /// /// # Note /// /// Actually returns a value of type `Result<(), Self::ErrorCode>`. #[ink(function = 3)] fn write(key: &[u8], value: &[u8]); /// Returns the access allowed for the key for the caller. /// /// # Note /// /// Assumes to never fail the call and therefore always returns `Option<Access>`. #[ink(function = 4, handle_status = false)] fn access(key: &[u8]) -> Option<Access>; /// Unlocks previously acquired permission to access key. /// /// # Errors /// /// If the permission was not granted. /// /// # Note /// /// Assumes the call to never fail and therefore does _NOT_ require `UnlockAccessError` /// to implement `From<Self::ErrorCode>` as in the `read_small` method above. #[ink(function = 5, handle_status = false)] fn unlock_access(key: &[u8], access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError>; } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteErrorCode { InvalidKey, CannotWriteToKey, CannotReadFromKey, } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteError { ErrorCode(ReadWriteErrorCode), BufferTooSmall { required_bytes: u32 }, } impl From<ReadWriteErrorCode> for ReadWriteError { fn from(error_code: ReadWriteErrorCode) -> Self { Self::ErrorCode(error_code) } } impl From<scale::Error> for ReadWriteError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub struct UnlockAccessError { reason: String, } impl From<scale::Error> for UnlockAccessError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum Access { ReadWrite, ReadOnly, WriteOnly, } impl ink::env::chain_extension::FromStatusCode for ReadWriteErrorCode { fn from_status_code(status_code: u32) -> Result<(), Self> { match status_code { 0 => Ok(()), 1 => Err(Self::InvalidKey), 2 => Err(Self::CannotWriteToKey), 3 => Err(Self::CannotReadFromKey), _ => panic!(\"encountered unknown status code\"), } } } All the error types and other utility types used in the chain extension definition above are often required to implement various traits such as SCALE's Encode and Decode as well as scale-info's TypeInfo trait. A full example of the above chain extension definition can be seen here. Example: Environment​ In order to allow ink! smart contracts to use the above defined chain extension it needs to be integrated into an Environment definition as shown below: type RuntimeReadWrite = i32; use ink::env::{Environment, DefaultEnvironment}; pub enum CustomEnvironment {} impl Environment for CustomEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::MAX_EVENT_TOPICS; type AccountId = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::AccountId; type Balance = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Balance; type Hash = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Hash; type BlockNumber = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::BlockNumber; type Timestamp = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Timestamp; type ChainExtension = RuntimeReadWrite; } Above we defined the CustomEnvironment which defaults to ink!'s DefaultEnvironment for all constants and types but the ChainExtension type which is assigned to our newly defined chain extension. Example: Usage​ An ink! smart contract can use the above defined chain extension through the Environment definition defined in the last example section using the env macro parameter as shown below. Note that chain extension methods are accessible through Self::extension() or self.extension(). For example as in Self::extension().read(..) or self.extension().read(..). #[ink::contract(env = CustomEnvironment)] mod read_writer { #[ink(storage)] pub struct ReadWriter {} impl ReadWriter { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn read(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ReadWriteErrorCode> { self.env() .extension() .read(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn read_small(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError> { self.env() .extension() .read_small(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn write( &self, key: Vec<u8>, value: Vec<u8>, ) -> Result<(), ReadWriteErrorCode> { self.env() .extension() .write(&key, &value) } #[ink(message)] pub fn access(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Option<Access> { self.env() .extension() .access(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn unlock_access(&self, key: Vec<u8>, access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError> { self.env() .extension() .unlock_access(&key, access) } } /// Custom chain extension to read to and write from the runtime. #[ink::chain_extension(extension = 12)] pub trait RuntimeReadWrite { type ErrorCode = ReadWriteErrorCode; #[ink(function = 1)] fn read(key: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>; #[ink(function = 2)] fn read_small(key: &[u8]) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError>; #[ink(function = 3)] fn write(key: &[u8], value: &[u8]); #[ink(function = 4, handle_status = false)] fn access(key: &[u8]) -> Option<Access>; #[ink(function = 5, handle_status = false)] fn unlock_access(key: &[u8], access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError>; } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteErrorCode { InvalidKey, CannotWriteToKey, CannotReadFromKey, } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteError { ErrorCode(ReadWriteErrorCode), BufferTooSmall { required_bytes: u32 }, } impl From<ReadWriteErrorCode> for ReadWriteError { fn from(error_code: ReadWriteErrorCode) -> Self { Self::ErrorCode(error_code) } } impl From<scale::Error> for ReadWriteError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub struct UnlockAccessError { reason: String, } impl From<scale::Error> for UnlockAccessError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] pub enum Access { ReadWrite, ReadOnly, WriteOnly, } impl ink::env::chain_extension::FromStatusCode for ReadWriteErrorCode { fn from_status_code(status_code: u32) -> Result<(), Self> { match status_code { 0 => Ok(()), 1 => Err(Self::InvalidKey), 2 => Err(Self::CannotWriteToKey), 3 => Err(Self::CannotReadFromKey), _ => panic!(\"encountered unknown status code\"), } } } pub enum CustomEnvironment {} impl ink::env::Environment for CustomEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::MAX_EVENT_TOPICS; type AccountId = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::AccountId; type Balance = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Balance; type Hash = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Hash; type BlockNumber = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::BlockNumber; type Timestamp = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Timestamp; type ChainExtension = RuntimeReadWrite; } } Using Multiple Chain Extensions​ It is possible to use multiple exposed chain extensions in the single environment of a smart contract. The declaration procedure of the chain extension stays the same. Suppose we want to combine two chain extension called Psp22Extension and FetchRandom, ink! provides a useful macro ink::combine_extensions! that allows to construct the structure combining the aforementioned chain extensions like so: ink::combine_extensions! { /// This extension combines the `FetchRandom` and `Psp22Extension` extensions. /// It is possible to combine any number of extensions in this way. /// /// This structure is an instance that is returned by the `self.env().extension()` call. pub struct CombinedChainExtension { /// The instance of the `Psp22Extension` chain extension. /// /// It provides you access to `PSP22` functionality. pub psp22: Psp22Extension, /// The instance of the `FetchRandom` chain extension. /// /// It provides you access to randomness functionality. pub rand: FetchRandom, } } The combined structure is called CombinedChainExtension, and we can refer to it when specifying the chain extension type in Environment: type ChainExtension = CombinedChainExtension; Each extension's method can be called by accessing it via the name of the field of CombineChainExtension: self.env().extension().rand.<method_name_in_rand_ext>() // or self.env().extension().psp22.<method_name_in_psp22_ext>() // e.g. self.env().extension().psp22.total_supply() note The ink! repository contains the full example illustrating how to combine existing chain extensions and mock them for testing. Mocking Chain Extension​ You can mock chain extensions for unit testing purposes. This can be achieved by implementing the ink::env::test::ChainExtension trait. /// Opaque structure struct MockedPSP22Extension; // Implementing impl ink::env::test::ChainExtension for MockedPSP22Extension { fn ext_id(&self) -> u16 { // It is identifier used by `psp22_extension::Psp22Extension` extension. // Must be the same as the once specified in `#[ink::chain_extension(extension = _)]` 13 } // Call dispatcher. // Call specific code based on the function id which is dispatched from the contract/ fn call(&mut self, func_id: u16, _input: &[u8], output: &mut Vec<u8>) -> u32 { match func_id { // `func_id` of the `total_supply` function. // must match `#[ink(function = _)]` of the corresponding method 0x162d => { ink::scale::Encode::encode_to(&TOTAL_SUPPLY, output); 0 }, // Other functions _ => { 1 } } } } Technical Limitations​ Due to technical limitations it is not possible to refer to the ErrorCode associated type using Self::ErrorCode anywhere within the chain extension and its defined methods. Instead chain extension authors should directly use the error code type when required. This limitation might be lifted in future versions of ink!. It is not possible to declare other chain extension traits as super traits or super chain extensions of another.

By default ink! creates a selector for each message and constructor. This is necessary since the contract is compiled to a Wasm blob and functions are invoked by invoking the selector, which identifies a method ‒ method names are no longer available in these underlying layers. Using this attribute it is possible to specify a concrete dispatch selector for the flagged entity. This allows a contract author to precisely control the selectors of their APIs making it possible to rename their API without breakage. A selector must be a u32 decodable integer. For example selector = 0xCAFEBABE selector = 42 An exception is the fallback selector _, allowing contract calls not matching any of the other message selectors to be dispatched to a fallback message. Fallback messages can be payable. Examples​ #[ink(message, selector = 0xC0DECAFE)] fn my_message_1(&self) {} #[ink(message, selector = 42)] fn my_message_2(&self) {} #[ink(message, payable, selector = _)] fn my_fallback(&self) {} … then the selector of my_message_1 is [0xC0, 0xDE, 0xCA, 0xFE] and the selector of my_message_2 is [0, 0, 0, 42] since setting the selector manually overrides the automatically generated selector. Controlling the messages selector​ Every ink! message and ink! constructor has a selector with which the message or constructor can be uniquely identified within the ink! smart contract. Non-unique message or constructor selector lead to a compile time error. These selectors are mainly used to drive the contract's dispatch upon calling it. An ink! smart contract author can control the selector of an ink! message or ink! constructor using the selector flag. An example is shown below: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] #[ink(selector = 0xDEADBEEF)] // Works on constructors as well. pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: initial_value } } #[ink(message)] #[ink(selector = 0xCAFEBABE)] // You can either specify selector out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } #[ink(message, selector = 0xC0DECAFE)] // ...or specify the selector inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Edit this page Previous #[ink(payable)] Next #[ink(storage)] Examples Controlling the messages selector","s":"#[ink(selector = S:u32)] | ink! documentation","u":"/5.x/macros-attributes/selector","h":"","p":523},{"i":526,"t":"Macros & Attributes #[ink(topic)] Version: 5.0-rc On this page Applied on fields of ink! event types to indicate that they are topics.

The set of ink! messages defined for an ink! smart contract define its API surface with which users are allowed to interact. An ink! smart contract can have multiple such ink! messages defined.

It is notable that the collections under ink_storage ‒ such as e.g. Vec or HashMap ‒ don't implement scale::Encode. This means you can't just return a Vec from an ink! message. This restriction is intentional ‒ returning a complete data structure with a potentially unbounded content is an anti-pattern for smart contracts. Just think about the unpredictable gas costs. If you really really need to return a data structure in its entirety then use the ones from ink_prelude (e.g. ink_prelude::vec::Vec). Those implement scale::Encode.

Head over to substrate.stackexchange.com to ask us any questions (there is an ink tag)! ink! 3.0 🦑​ The star of the show this month is the release of ink! 3.0: You can find the release notes here. We've also published a blog post with some more context: ink! 3.0: Parity’s Rust-Based Language for WASM Smart Contracts Gets a Major Update. The team has been working on this release for a while. If you're a developer you're probably aware of this thanks to the long list of release candidates (v3.0.0-rcX) we've pushed out in preparation for the stable 3.0 release. The main idea behind ink! 3.0 is that it's just Rust. The syntax is pretty much identical, and all the tooling you know and love, such as rust-analyzer and Clippy, just works. Some other included changes worth highlighting: Reduced contract sizes for better performance in a parachain context. Support for cross-contract calls, making it easier to write complex applications. Trait support, allowing for a more Rusty development experience. cargo-contract 1.0​ Alongside the release of ink! 3.0 we're also releasing cargo-contract in its first stable version 1.0. cargo-contract is a handy developer tool for building, testing, and deploying ink! contracts. Some notable updates in this release include: Support for uploading and calling contracts on a chain with pallet-contracts. Linting rules for ink! contracts, giving developers warnings about common errors. Delegate Call​ Another update worth pointing out is the addition of delegate_call. What this allows is a way for contracts to forward a call they received to another contract. One use case for this is implementing a Proxy Upgrade Pattern for smart contracts.

Developers can go from an idea to a fully functioning web3 application \"in production\" in a matter of hours or days. This allows faster feedback on ideas, to validate whether there is user demand in the first place, and to easily iterate and refine the implementation. For many applications, smart contracts are good enough. However, they are exposed to the inherent limitations of the smart contract execution environment: Sharing of blockspace with other smart contracts, volatile \"gas\" fees. Default model enforces gas fees being paid by the end user. Relative poor performance of interpreted smart contract (untrusted) code compared to pre-compiled Parachain runtime (trusted) code. Limited access to the host chain environment and any special functionality provided by an extensive suite of customisable FRAME pallets. Once a web3 application has proven it can work, the team may consider \"upgrading\" to a Parachain to unlock the full power of a dedicated App Chain. Compared to developing and deploying a smart contract, this requires considerably more time and expertise, which is why we encourage to start with ink! where possible, at least at the prototype stage. Much of the difficulty in launching a parachain comes in configuring a node implementation, bootstrapping and maintaining a collator network, deploying to testnets, managing infrastructure, acquiring \"Coretime\" (previously via a slot auction). All of which is time consuming and costly. This is important to note because this guide will focus on the migration of the code from ink! to FRAME, which might be a learning curve but overall a minor part of the overall migration, and a one-off cost. Utilizing existing FRAME pallets​ There is a rich library of FRAME pallets, which may provide a drop in replacement for some (or all) of your smart contract functionality. For example, for a PSP22 (similar to ERC20) fungible token contract, this could be replaced either by the native Parachain token itself via pallet_balances or by an asset on pallet_assets. Governance functions could be replaced by e.g. pallet_democracy, and so on. See polkadot-sdk for a range of pre-built pallets which can be used to handle some common functions. Similarities and differences between ink! and FRAME​ Similar​ The biggest advantage we have when migrating from ink! to FRAME is that both are Rust based DSLs, in both cases actual Rust (or Rust-like) code annotated with attributes expands into Rust code for handling all the boilerplate for integrating into their respective execution environments. Indeed the modern FRAME 2.0 was originally inspired by the ink! approach of attribute macros annotating Rust code. So we can assume that the developer performing the migration is already familiar with Rust and its development environment, which is already a huge headstart for developing with FRAME. Next we can assume some familiarity with the execution environment, after all a contract is running inside of pallet_contracts and is invoked in a similar way via a pallet dispatchable, has access to storage (sandboxed to the contract), and can emit events. Different​ The biggest difference is that a contract is user uploaded and therefore untrusted code, so there are restrictions to what the contract is able to do and it will perform slower because it is interpreted. For example, a contract can only read and write from its own sandboxed storage. Runtime code built using FRAME is trusted, can be pre-compiled and therefore executes significantly faster (though that may change if/when contracts are able to target PolkaVM). Pallets have direct access to other pallets and have full access to the Parachain storage, and the permissioning can be configured as desired. Because ink! is executing in a more constrained environment, it is able to be much more opinionated and therefore a simpler language. Because execution is metered (pay as you go execution by the user), there is no need to worry about benchmarking for \"weight\" calculation. FRAME is more powerful, but necessarily more complicated. Example Migration​ We'll use the DNS example contract to demonstrate a migration. Setup​ Start by cloning the Parachain Template which contains a template pallet which we can modify. Now we will move down the contract from top to bottom and begin the migration of code. Event Definitions​ First thing we encounter are events. E.g.: #[ink(event)] pub struct Register { #[ink(topic)] name: Hash, #[ink(topic)] from: AccountId, } Each of these structs annotated with #[ink(event)] can be translated to a variant in the pallet Error enum annotated with #[pallet::error]. Any of the ink! environment type aliases (both Hash and AccountId in the above example) must be translated to their equivalent associated type on the Config trait e.g. AccountId -> T::AccountId. Also the #[ink(topic)] annotations must be removed: topics must be calculated manually when the event is emitted, and will be covered later. Remove the #[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)] and the final Event type will look like: #[pallet::event] pub enum Event<T: Config> { Register { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, }, SetAddress { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, old_address: Option<T::AccountId>, new_address: T::AccountId, }, Transfer { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, old_owner: Option<T::AccountId>, new_owner: T::AccountId, } } Storage​ The storage layout of the contract is defined by the following struct: #[ink(storage)] pub struct DomainNameService { /// A hashmap to store all name to addresses mapping. name_to_address: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, /// A hashmap to store all name to owners mapping. name_to_owner: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, /// The default address. default_address: AccountId, } In ink!, the layout of the contract storage is defined by this top level struct. A brief recap of how this is used: Constructors must return an initialized instance of this struct, which is then written to storage. Non mutable messages e.g. #[ink(message)] fn message(&self, ..) will load an instance of this struct and pass it as &self. Mutable messages e.g. #[ink(message)] fn message(&mut self, ..), will load an instance of the struct and persist it if the message succeeds in executing. Fields of type Mapping or Lazy are not written directly into the same storage slot as the parent, but are wrappers around direct reads/writes to storage under many or a single key respectively. In FRAME, all storage operations happen eagerly via \"type aliases\" annotated with #[pallet::storage]. So for each field in the #[ink(storage)] struct, we require a corresponding pallet storage definition. default_address: AccountId translates to: #[pallet::storage] pub type DefaultAddress<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, T::AccountId>; name_to_address: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, translates to a StorageMap like so: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToAddress<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; name_to_owner: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, also translates to a StorageMap: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToOwner<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; Reading and writing these storage values must all be done explicitly, in contrast with ink! which can do so automatically for non \"lazy\" values. When it comes to migrating the messages, this will be demonstrated. Error Definition​ Simply copy across the variants of the enum Error to the equivalent #[pallet::error] definition. In our case we end up with: #[pallet::error] pub enum Error<T> { /// Returned if the name already exists upon registration. NameAlreadyExists, /// Returned if caller is not owner while required to. CallerIsNotOwner, } Note that the T generic parameter is not used in this case, the error macro handles the generation of PhantomData<T>. If we use some environmental types we can use the T similar to the event definition. Constructors​ In this example, the single constructor is simply initializing the storage to empty values. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Default::default() } This code is executed when the contract instance was initialized. Our use case is a migration, so we will assume that the existing data must be migrated from contract storage to the pallet storage. This will be covered in the Data Migration section. No code migration is required then for this constructor. Messages​ Mutable​ There are 3 mutable messages (that can change the state of the contract): register, set_address and transfer. This guide will demonstrate register, and the other two can follow a similar pattern. The message is defined as so, with added numerical comments to show the translation to the equivalent FRAME code. #[ink(message)] pub fn register(&mut self, name: Hash) -> Result<()> { // 1. let caller = self.env().caller(); // 2. if self.name_to_owner.contains(name) { return Err(Error::NameAlreadyExists) } // 3. self.name_to_owner.insert(name, &caller); // 4. self.env().emit_event(Register { name, from: caller }); // 5. Ok(()) } Before proceeding, it is necessary to add a custom deposit_event function for raising events which accepts topics: impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> { fn deposit_event(topics: Vec<T::Hash>, event: Event<T>) { <frame_system::Pallet<T>>::deposit_event_indexed( &topics, <T as Config>::RuntimeEvent::from(event).into() ) } } Now we can translate the register message into a \"Dispatchable\": #[pallet::call_index(0)] #[pallet::weight(Weight::from_parts(10_000, 0) .saturating_add(T::DbWeight::get().reads(1)) .saturating_add(T::DbWeight::get().writes(1)))] pub fn register(origin: OriginFor<T>, name: T::Hash) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { // 1. let caller = ensure_signed(origin)?; // 2. ensure!(!NameToOwner::<T>::contains_key(&name), Error::<T>::NameAlreadyExists); // 3. <NameToOwner<T>>::insert(name, &caller); // 4. Self::deposit_event( &[name.clone(), T::Hashing::hash_of(&caller)], Event::Register { name, from: caller } ); // 5. Ok(().into()) } Compare the numbered annotations from the ink! contract message and the FRAME dispatchable, and you can see they are very similar, just different APIs for interacting with the environment and with storage. For 4., in FRAME we need to generate the topic list manually which is done automatically in ink! via the annotations. Weights​ The pallet::weight attribute defines the weight of the dispatchable i.e. the amount of onchain resources it is estimated to consume. Because we are now writing trusted code, we can define this up front (no runtime gas metering). The number in the weight is typically generated via a benchmarking process. It is important to integrate this process and set a non-arbitrary value here before deploying to a production chain. Read more https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/. Immutable (read only) messages​ ink! messages can return a value, which when executed as an RPC \"dry-run\" (not via a transaction), are used to read the state of contracts. Dispatchables in FRAME cannot return values directly. There are two ways to read the state from a FRAME pallet: Reading from #[pallet::storage] items directly, client libraries will generate an API to do this from the runtime metadata. See e.g. subxt Via runtime APIs, RPC methods that can be wired up directly into query methods on a pallet. See https://docs.substrate.io/reference/runtime-apis/. In our case, 1. is good enough, so the following read only message: #[ink(message)] pub fn get_address(&self, name: Hash) -> AccountId { self.get_address_or_default(name) } fn get_address_or_default(&self, name: Hash) -> AccountId { self.name_to_address .get(name) .unwrap_or(self.default_address) } Can be queried without any modifications to the NameToAddress storage type: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToAddress<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; subxt would generate the following accessor for querying the storage: let storage_query = my_custom_chain::storage().dns().name_to_address(&name); // Use that query to `fetch` a result. This returns an `Option<_>`, which will be // `None` if no value exists at the given address. You can also use `fetch_default` // where applicable, which will return the default value if none exists. let result = api .storage() .at_latest() .await? .fetch(&storage_query) .await?; Data Migration​ Data migration can be done at either genesis time or once the custom parachain is up and running. Retrieving the data from the contract​ In both cases the first steps are to first download the current state of the contract at a fixed point in time, and then ensuring that no changes can be made to the contract after that. This could be done by using set_code_hash to update the source code of the contract to a special contract which allows only querying and downloading the state of the current contract, and no mutating messages. An alternative would be querying the contract storage directly, but currently there are no good tools for this, and it would require some key calculation for retrieving the data at all storage locations. Additionally the contract would still need to be \"frozen\" somehow to ensure no changes can be made to the contract state. Initializing the pallet​ Once the data has been downloaded and serialized, it can be used to initialize the state of the custom parachain runtime. This can be hardcoded in a #[pallet::genesis_build] impl block. See https://docs.substrate.io/reference/how-to-guides/basics/configure-genesis-state/. Alternatively the state could be initialized via dispatchable extrinsic(s) which initialize the storage. Adjusting UIs​ User interfaces will need to be adjusted to interact with a pallet rather than a contract. This should be relatively straightforward since client libraries usually have first-class support for interacting with Substrate pallets, and the signing etc. should already be integrated.

We discussed our roadmap for the rest of this year, as well as some technical designs of how we want to implement e.g. XCM in ink!. We're normally working across different time zones, with some of us embracing the digital nomad lifestyle. Hence it was very productive to gather together for a week. We also did a little hackathon to do some dog-fooding: we've built a dApp that makes use of all components by the above teams. We plan to open source it soon, stay tuned for that 😎. There's a lot on the horizon and we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year! Spanish Twitter Space 🐦​ Hernando was a guest at the spanish Polkadot Twitter Space. The space has been recorded: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnkgmNdBJO. StackExchange Public Beta​ The Substrate & Polkadot StackExchange site has graduated from its private beta ‒ the site is now in public beta! This means that the site is now indexed by search engines and can be browser without any user account. If you have any questions regarding ink! or smart contracts on Substrate this is the place to be. Canvas Update​ You may know that we were working on a common good smart contracts parachain named Canvas. We've decided to put this project on hold. This gives us more room to make ink! and the pallet-contracts as competitive as possible, as well as help parachain teams include those. This is not to say that we'll never get back to Canvas, but as of right now we're no longer working on this project.

Over the last few years we’ve seen contributions in all forms bring the project to where it stands today. Thank you for writing your contracts in ink!, for creating issues and pull requests, for providing us with good and constructive feedback, for answering questions on Substrate StackExchange, for creating third-party tooling for ink!, for writing blog posts about us, and for holding workshops! A lot has happened over the last few years in the ink! world. The first commit was in December 2018 and our current version is v3.3.1. We’re working hard on shipping the next major iteration with v4.0 soon. An open point that comes up regularly is that we’ve never written an article explaining from start to finish what ink! is and how it ties into Substrate and Polkadot. This occasion was a great opportunity to do just that! You can find the article at https://www.parity.io/blog/what-is-paritys-ink.

One of those is wasm-opt, which we use for optimizing the WebAssembly file size of an ink! contract. Having this tool as an external dependency is causing friction for beginners. They have to install it manually and the process varies for each operating system. It bloats up the cargo-contract installation instructions and people not following them properly run into errors because of a missing dependency. Luckily @brson and @aimeedeer have applied for a Web3 Foundation (W3F) grant to fix exactly that for wasm-opt! They've delivered the first milestone ‒ a proof of concept ‒ this month. You can read their summary here. Their next milestone is the integration into cargo-contract which will reduce our installation instructions by one step 🙌!

We were holding lectures on WebAssembly smart contracts as part of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy! This was the first, intentionally low-key, run of a Polkadot education program with an academic focus. This first run was low-key to smooth out the edges and verify if our idea of a curriculum worked out in the real world. It did and there will be many more academies! Starting with the next one, which is happening in January and February 2023 in Buenos Aires. We will also be giving lectures there again! You can find more details on http://dot.li/academy.

They are working on a UI for the DEX as well. You can find the repository here: AstarNetwork/wasm-tutorial-dex. Release Updates 🆕​ We've published a release of ink! v3.4 this month. For ink! v4.0 and cargo-contract v2.0 we decided to shift our target release date a bit, to January 2023. There are a number of reasons why we decided to do this: We have made a number of breaking changes and want to wait until popular user interfaces (like polkadot-js or contracts-ui) support those. We want to have a release candidate out for at least some weeks to give everyone the chance to already upgrade tooling and provide feedback. We have an audit going on and would ideally like to incorporate more of the results. A breaking change that has formed in the last weeks is that we will have to remove ink::env::random. This function allowed contract developers getting random entropy. There is unfortunately no way how this can be done safely enough with built-in Substrate primitives on-chain currently. We're following the recommendation of our auditors to remove it. The alternative right now is to provide random entropy off-chain to the contract, to use a random entropy oracle, or to have a chain-extension that does this, in case the chain has a possibility to do so. We hope to bring this function back in a future release of ink!, the best hope right now is that it could come back with Sassafras, a block production protocol for future versions of Polkadot. Conference Season 📢​ Many from our team have been on the road in the last weeks. You might have met us at DappCon, DevCon, or EuroRust. There's more to come and a number of us will be at sub0 in Lisbon at the end of November '22. We have two events scheduled there, a talk and a fireside chat. Come by and talk to us if you're there! Blog Post on wasm-opt-rs 🙌​ Brian Anderson wrote a blog post on his Web3 Foundation grant to get rid of wasm-opt as an external dependency for cargo-contract. This was a contribution that we looked forward to a lot. External dependencies cause so much user friction. For once, it's another manual step in the installation process, which is not always straight forward and different for each operating system. There's other issues too, we don't have control over which version of the dependency is installed on the local system and have to throw errors to the user, causing more user friction. All of this is just solved now by having wasm-opt be a direct dependency of cargo-contract. The blog post is an interesting read, you can find it on Brian's blog here. Solang Solidity compiler incubated into Hyperledger Foundation 🎉​ ink! contracts are executed by Substrate's pallet-contracts; besides ink! there are two other languages that you can use to write smart contracts for this pallet: ask! (Assembly Script) and Solidity via the Solang compiler. Solang supports different blockchains as compiler targets, one of them being pallet-contracts. Our colleague @xermicus is working full-time on this Substrate backend in Solang. The project has now been incubated into the Hyperledger Foundation, hosted by the Linux Foundation. This is a big recognition for the project!

The distinction here is that in the context of Polkadot and Kusama a parachain leases a slot for a couple of months for up to two years. The deal with a lease is that the parachain gets a fixed slot for executing its business logic (typically referred to as its state transition function) and can persist its modified state in a block. In Substrate terminology this state transition function is called the chain's runtime. The distinction to other ecosystems here is that, in the context of Polkadot, parachains and smart contracts exist at different layers of the stack: smart contracts sit on top of parachains. Parachains would usually be described as layer-1 blockchains ‒ except for that they don't have to build their own security, are upgradable, and interoperable. It's noteworthy that a parachain's state transition function doesn't get further validated ‒ it's up to the parachain how it utilizes its slot time. The parachain already pre-paid for its slot when it won the slot auction on Polkadot or Kusama. This means the parachain can build its own (blockchain) world! For example, it can decide on how transaction fees are charged ‒ or even if transaction fees are charged at all. These options are crucial when building new or more user-friendly business models. Other distinguishing factors between parachains that we observe in the wild are differences in how governance works or the crypto-economics. There are some constraints on how the parachain can build its world though. Like physics in the real world it has to adhere to certain ground rules. For Polkadot and Kusama that's for example the consensus algorithm for the Relay Chain to communicate with the parachain. From those ground rules the advantages of Polkadot and Kusama emerge. Advantages like the aforementioned shared security, cross-chain communication, or guaranteed execution slot time. For smart contracts, on the other hand, an existing parachain has to include the pallet-contracts for users to deploy smart contracts. The deployed smart contract is always untrusted code. Anyone (or any program) that has tokens of the chain can upload a smart contract without requiring permission. Smart contracts allow permissionless deployment of untrusted programs on a blockchain. The pallet-contracts has to assume that these programs are adversarial, it has to put a number of safety pillars in place to ensure that the contract can not e.g. stall the chain or cause state corruption of other contracts. For pallet-contracts those safety pillars include mechanisms like gas metering or deposits for storing data on-chain. To restate this important distinction: developing a parachain runtime is different from developing a smart contract ‒ a smart contract sits on top of a parachain. The trade-off is that with a parachain one has the freedom to decide on (nearly) all the rules that make up the parachain. With a smart contract one is constrained by what the chain allows and the safety pillars that necessarily have to be in place. A smart contract can never be as fast as a native pallet built in the parachain runtime ‒ there is too much logic in between. A smart contract on the other hand has less friction for developing and deploying it. Developers don't have to take care of governance, crypto-economics, etc. One just needs a few tokens and can go on its merry way deploying a smart contract. It's as simple as that.

Version: 5.0-rc Why Rust for Smart Contracts? ink! chooses not to invent a new programming language, but rather adapt a subset of Rust to serve our purpose. If this doesn't already convince you, you find many more good reasons here: Rust is an ideal smart contract language: It is type safe, memory safe, and free of undefined behaviors. It generates small binaries because it doesn’t include extra bloat, like a garbage collector, and advanced optimizations and tree shaking remove dead code. Through compiler flags, Rust can automatically protect against integer overflow. Rust ecosystem: You gain from all of the support available to the Rust ecosystem for free. As the language develops, ink! will automatically gain access to new features and functionality, improving how you can write smart contracts in the future. Tooling: Because ink! follows Rust standards, tools like rustfmt, clippy and rust-analyzer already work out of the box. The same goes for code formatting and syntax highlighting in most modern text editors. Also, Rust has an integrated test and benchmark runner, No overhead: Minimal runtime. Safe & Efficient: Zero-cost & safe abstractions. Productive: Cargo + crates.io Ecosystem. 1st class Wasm: Rust provides the first class support for the WebAssembly. Small Size: In the space-constrained blockchain world size is important. The Rust compiler is a great help for that, since it reorders struct fields in order to make each type as small as possible.

We have a live testnet named Contracts as a parachain online there. What is the Contracts parachain?​ It's a Substrate parachain for smart contracts. We configured it to use Substrate's smart contracts module – the contracts pallet – in a default configuration. The code for this parachain can be found in the cumulus repository. Our parachain uses the Rococo relay chain's native token (ROC) instead of having its own token. Due to this you'll need ROC in order to deploy contracts on our testnet. How can I use it?​ (1) Create an Account​ As a first step, you should create an account. This can be done via command-line tools (e.g. subxt) or via a wallet (e.g. with the polkadot-js browser extension). See here for a detailed guide. (2) Get Testnet Tokens​ As a second step, you have to get ROC testnet tokens through the Rococo Faucet. Alternatively, you can use the Element chat room. You must send a message like this (Note the :1002 after the wallet address): !drip YOUR_SS_58_ADDRESS:1002 The number 1002 is the parachain ID of Contracts on Rococo, by supplying it you instruct the faucet to teleport ROC tokens directly to your account on the parachain. If you have some tokens on the Rococo relay chain, you can teleport them to the Contracts parachain on your own. Read more on teleporting assets here. If everything worked out, the teleported ROC tokens will show up in your account. In case you are using the polkadot-js frontend, you can see them under the \"Accounts\" tab for Contracts. (3) Deploy Your Contract​ Once you have ROC on Contracts you can deploy a contract nearly as you would with a local developer node. The only difference is that you can't use pre-endowed accounts like Alice or Bob, you have to use the one you generated instead. You can also deploy your contract from the command-line via cargo-contract. Make sure you are in the folder of your contract and that it has been built recently. Then execute: cargo contract upload --suri \"your twelve or twenty-four words\" cargo contract instantiate --suri … --constructor new --args true new in this case would be a constructor method exposed by the contract, --args would be any arguments the constructor expects.

Version: 5.0-rc Why WebAssembly for Smart Contracts? We made a conscious decision for WebAssembly as the target architecture of ink!. Our decision was made up by these reasons: High performance: Wasm is high performance — it’s built to be as close to native machine code as possible while still being platform independent. Small size: It facilitates small binaries to ship over the internet to devices with potentially slow internet connection. This is a great fit for the space-constrained blockchain world. General VM & bytecode: It was developed so that code can be deployed in any browser with the same result. Contrary to the EVM it was not developed towards a very specific use case, this has the benefit of a lot of tooling being available and large companies putting a lot of resources into furthering Wasm development. Efficient JIT execution: 64 and 32-bit integer operation support that maps one-to-one with CPU instructions. Minimalistic: Formal spec that fits on a single page. Deterministic execution: Wasm is easily made deterministic by removing floating point operations, which is necessary for consensus algorithms. Open Standards > Custom Solutions: Wasm is a standard for web browsers developed by W3C workgroup that includes Google, Mozilla, and others. There’s been many years of work put into Wasm, both by compiler and standardization teams. Many languages available: Wasm expands the family of languages available to smart contract developers to include Rust, C/C++, C#, Typescript, Haxe, and Kotlin. This means you can write smart contracts in whichever language you’re familiar with, though we’re partial to Rust due to its lack of runtime overhead and inherent security properties. Memory-safe, sandboxed, and platform-independent. LLVM support: Supported by the LLVM compiler infrastructure project, meaning that Wasm benefits from over a decade of LLVM’s compiler optimization. Large companies involved: Continually developed by major companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Facebook. Edit this page Previous Why Rust for Smart Contracts?

Set the log level of your node to runtime::contracts=debug. For example, to have only errors and debug output show up for the substrate-contracts-node: substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug Set the log level of your node to runtime::contracts::strace to trace host function calls. These function calls logs will also be displayed in the Debug message panel of Contracts UI. For example, to view these traces in addition to the logs described above: substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug,runtime::contracts::strace=trace Example​ The following code depicts how to print debug statements from a message or constructor. #[ink(constructor)] fn new() -> Self { ink::env::debug_println!(\"created new instance at {}\", Self::env().block_number()); Self { } } #[ink(message)] fn print(&self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let message = ink_prelude::format!(\"got a call from {:?}\", caller); ink::env::debug_println!(&message); } note Debug output is not printed for transactions! It is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests. Decode Data Payload You can use a block explorer or an app like PolkadotJs to retrieve the data payload of a contract transaction, and then use cargo-contract to decode it. # From your contract directory cargo contract decode message -d fe5bd8ea01000000 This command will output the method name and parameters encoded in the data payload: Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 } If the contract was called through a cross-contract interaction, the payload will not be available in the transaction. In such cases, you can use the approach described in the next section to access it. Replay and Debug a Block To replay a transaction, you can use Chopstick to create a local fork of the chain and replay the block with trace-level logging. Assuming you have a node that you can connect to at $ENDPOINT and the transaction you want to replay is in block $BLOCK_HASH, you can use the following command: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest run-block \\ --endpoint $ENDPOINT \\ --block $BLOCK_HASH \\ --runtime-log-level 5 \\ | grep runtime::contracts This command replays the block with trace-level logging enabled. By filtering the output with runtime::contracts, you can view all the contract calls in the block: runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [246, 118, 44, 201] runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0] runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } From here, you can identify the call you are interested in and decode the data payload: echo 254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0 \\ | tr ',' ' ' \\ | xargs printf '%02x' \\ | xargs cargo contract decode message -d This command will output the following: Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 } Fork Node and Replay Transactions You can also use Chopstick to start a local fork of your chain. This command starts a fork beginning at block $BLOCK_HASH. You can connect to this fork using ws://localhost:8000 to submit extrinsics via PolkadotJs or cargo contract: npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest \\ --endpoint $ENDPOINT \\ --block $BLOCK_HASH \\ --runtime-log-level 5 Here, for example, you can re-run the transaction that we decoded in the previous section: cargo contract call \\ --contract $CONTRACT_ADDR \\ --message inc_by --args 1 \\ --suri //Alice \\ --url ws://localhost:8000 Since trace-level logging is used, you will receive detailed information about all the host functions called during the execution of the contract: runtime::contracts TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 2, 0, 0, 0] runtime::contracts TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] } runtime::contracts DEBUG: Execution finished with debug buffer: seal0::value_transferred(out_ptr: 65488, out_len_ptr: 65516) = Ok(()) seal0::input(out_ptr: 65536, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(()) seal1::get_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, out_ptr: 65540, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(Success) seal2::set_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, value_ptr: 65540, value_len: 4) = Ok(4) seal0::seal_return(flags: 0, data_ptr: 65536, data_len: 1) = Err(TrapReason::Return(ReturnData { flags: 0, data: [0] })) Edit this page Previous Contract Testing Next Contract Verification How do I print to the terminal console from ink!?

These are the types that ink! uses, if no explicit steps are taken: /// The fundamental types of the default configuration. #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)] #[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(TypeInfo))] pub enum DefaultEnvironment {} impl Environment for DefaultEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 4; type AccountId = ink_primitives::AccountId; type Balance = u128; type Hash = ink_primitives::Hash; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = NoChainExtension; } The context here is that you can use ink! on any blockchain that was built with the Substrate framework and includes the pallet-contracts module. Chains built on Substrate can decide on their own which types they want to use for e.g. the chain's block number or account id's. For example, chains that intend to be compatible to Ethereum typically use the same type as Ethereum for their AccountId. Most Substrate chains stay with the default Substrate types though and ink! just uses those by default as well. It is possible to configure a different environment in the contract macro (documentation here) though: #[ink::contract(env = MyCustomTypes)] Edit this page Previous Environment Functions Next Metadata","s":"Chain Environment Types","u":"/basics/chain-environment-types","h":"","p":577},{"i":580,"t":"Basics Contract Testing Version: 4.x On this page Contract Testing ink! supports three different stages of testing: unit, integration and end-to-end tests. On this page we'll explain what the purpose of each stage is about and how to use it. Generally you can think of those three types of testing as a pyramid with the top being the most elaborate test. The End-to-End (E2E) tests at the top will test the lower layers of the pyramid as part of them. Unit Tests​ Testing contracts off-chain is done by cargo test and users can simply use the standard Rust routines of creating unit test modules within the ink! project: #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; #[test] fn my_test() { ... } } Test instances of contracts can be created with something like: let contract = MyContract::my_constructor(a, b); Messages can simply be called on the returned instance as if MyContract::my_constructor returns a Self instance. See the flipper example. Off-chain Tests​ For integration tests, the test is annotated with our #[ink::test] attribute instead of #[test]. Our attribute denotes that the test is then executed in a simulated, mocked blockchain environment. here are functions available to influence how the test environment is configured (e.g. setting a specified balance of an account to simulate how a contract would behave when interacting with it). If you annotate a test with the #[ink::test] attribute it will be executed in a simulated environment, similar to as it would be run on-chain. You then have fine-grained control over how a contract is called; for example you can influence the block advancement, the value transferred to it, by which account it is called, which storage it is run with, etc.. See the examples/erc20 contract on how to utilize those or the documentation for details. At the moment there are some known limitations to our off-chain environment, and we are working on making it behave as close to the real chain environment as possible. note One limitation of the off-chain testing framework is that it currently only supports a DefaultEnvironment. See here for an explanation of what an environment is. How do you find out if your test requires the off-chain environment?​ Normally if the test recursively uses or invokes some contract methods that call a method defined in self.env() or Self::env(). An example is the following: let caller: AccountId = self.env().caller(); Example​ #[cfg(test)] mod tests { // Conventional unit test that works with assertions. #[ink::test] fn test1() { // test code comes here as usual } // Conventional unit test that returns some Result. // The test code can make use of operator-`?`. #[ink::test] fn test2() -> Result<(), ink::env::Error> { // test code that returns a Rust Result type } } End-to-End (E2E) Tests​ E2E testing enables developers to write a test that will not only test the contract in an isolated manner; instead the contract will be tested together with all components that will be involved on-chain – so from end to end. This way of testing resembles closely how the contract will actually behave in production. As part of the test, the contract will be compiled and deployed to a Substrate node that is running in the background. ink! offers API functions that enable developers to then interact with the contract via transactions that they create and submit to the blockchain. You as a developer can define assertions on the outcome of their transactions, such as checking for state mutations, transaction failures or incurred gas costs. Your chain configuration will be tested together with the smart contract. And if your chain has pallets that are involved with the smart contract execution, those will be part of the test execution as well. ink! does not put any requirements on the Substrate node in the background – for example, you can run a node that contains a snapshot of a live network. Example​ The following code example illustrates a basic E2E test for the flipper example. #[ink_e2e::test] async fn default_works(mut client: ink_e2e::Client<C, E>) -> E2EResult<()> { // When the function is entered, the contract was already // built in the background via `cargo contract build`. // The `client` object exposes an interface to interact // with the Substrate node. // given let constructor = FlipperRef::new_default(); // when let contract_acc_id = client .instantiate(\"flipper\", &ink_e2e::bob(), constructor, 0, None) .await .expect(\"instantiate failed\") .account_id; // then let get = build_message::<FlipperRef>(contract_acc_id.clone()) .call(|flipper| flipper.get()); let get_res = client .call(&ink_e2e::bob(), get, 0, None) .await .expect(\"get failed\"); assert!(matches!(get_res.return_value(), false)); Ok(()) } You can run the above test by going to the flipper folder in the ink! examples directory. Before you can run the test, you have to install a Substrate node with pallet-contracts. By default e2e tests require that you install substrate-contracts-node. You do not need to run it in the background since the node is started for each test independently. To install the latest version: cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git If you want to run any other node with pallet-contracts you need to change CONTRACTS_NODE environment variable: export CONTRACTS_NODE=\"YOUR_CONTRACTS_NODE_PATH\" And finally execute the following command to start e2e test execution. cargo test --features e2e-tests Edit this page Previous Metadata Next Contract Debugging Unit Tests Off-chain Tests How do you find out if your test requires the off-chain environment?

Emitting events can be used by third party tools to query information about a contract's execution and state. Example​ The following example ink! contract shows how an event Transferred is defined and emitted in the #[ink(constructor)]. #[ink::contract] mod erc20 { /// Defines an event that is emitted /// every time value is transferred. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transferred { from: Option<AccountId>, to: Option<AccountId>, value: Balance, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Erc20 { total_supply: Balance, // more fields ... } impl Erc20 { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), value: initial_supply, }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply } } #[ink(message)] pub fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { self.total_supply } } } See our ERC20 example contract for an elaborate example which uses events. Event Definition​ This is how an event definition looks: #[ink(event)] pub struct Transferred { #[ink(topic)] from: Option<AccountId>, #[ink(topic)] to: Option<AccountId>, amount: Balance } Add the #[ink(topic)] attribute tag to each item in your event that you want to have indexed. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself if somebody might want to search for this topic. For this reason the amount in the exemplary event above was not made indexable ‒ there will most probably be a lot of different events with differing amounts each. The signature of the event is by default one of the topics of the event, except if you annotate the event with #[ink(anonymous)]. See here for details on this attribute. Emitting Events in a Constructor​ In a constructor events are emitted via Self::env().emit_event(). See this example: #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); let mut balances = HashMap::new(); balances.insert(caller, initial_supply); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), amount: initial_supply }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply, balances } } Emitting Events from Messages​ In a message events are emitted via self.env().emit_event(): #[ink(message)] pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance) -> Result { let from = self.env().caller(); // implementation hidden self.env().emit_event(Transferred { from: Some(from), to: Some(to), amount }); Ok(()) } Edit this page Previous Mutating Storage Values Next Selectors Example Event Definition Emitting Events in a Constructor Emitting Events from Messages","s":"Events","u":"/basics/events","h":"","p":581},{"i":584,"t":"Basics Contract Template Version: 4.x On this page Contract Template On this page we'll go over how to create a basic contract and explain its elements.

There are a few approaches to performing these cross-contract calls in ink!: Contract references (i.e ContractRef) Builders (i.e CreateBuilder and CallBuilder) Contract references can only be used for cross-contract calls to other ink! contracts. Builders can be used to issue cross-contract calls to any Wasm contract, such as those written in ink!, Solang, or ask!. Contract References​ Contract references refer to structs that are generated by the ink! code generation for the purposes of cross-contract calls. They give developers a type-safe way of interacting with a contract. A downside to using them is that you need to import the contract you want to call as a dependency of your own contract. If you want to interact with a contract that is already on-chain you will need to use the Builders approach instead. BasicContractRef walkthrough​ We will walk through the basic_contract_ref example in order to demonstrate how cross-contract calls using contract references work. The general workflow will be: Prepare OtherContract to be imported to other contracts Import OtherContract into BasicContractRef Upload OtherContract on-chain Instantiate OtherContract using BasicContractRef Call OtherContract using BasicContractRef Prepping OtherContract​ We need to make sure that the ink! generated contract ref for OtherContract is available to other pieces of code. We do this by re-exporting the contract reference as follows: pub use self::other_contract::OtherContractRef; Importing OtherContract​ Next, we need to import OtherContract to our BasicContractRef contract. First, we add the following lines to our Cargo.toml file: # In `basic_contract_ref/Cargo.toml` other_contract = { path = \"other_contract\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] } # -- snip -- [features] default = [\"std\"] std = [ \"ink/std\", # -- snip -- \"other_contract/std\", ] Two things to note here: If we don't specify the ink-as-dependency feature we will end up with linking errors. If we don't enable the std feature for std builds we will not be able to generate our contract's metadata. Wiring BasicContractRef​ First, we will import the contract reference of OtherContract, and declare the reference to be part of our storage struct. // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` use other_contract::OtherContractRef; #[ink(storage)] pub struct BasicContractRef { other_contract: OtherContractRef, } Next, we to add a way to instantiate OtherContract. We do this from the constructor of our of contract. // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(other_contract_code_hash: Hash) -> Self { let other_contract = OtherContractRef::new(true) .code_hash(other_contract_code_hash) .endowment(0) .salt_bytes([0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF]) .instantiate(); Self { other_contract } } Note that for instantiating a contract we need access to the uploaded on-chain code_hash. We will get back to this later. Once we have an instantiated reference to OtherContract we can call its messages just like normal Rust methods! // In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs` #[ink(message)] pub fn flip_and_get(&mut self) -> bool { self.other_contract.flip(); self.other_contract.get() } Uploading OtherContract​ You will need the substrate-contracts-node running in the background for the next steps. We can upload OtherContract using cargo-contract as follows: # In the `basic_contract_ref` directory cargo contract build --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml cargo contract upload --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml --suri //Alice If successful, this will output in a code_hash similar to: Code hash \"0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa\" We can then use this code_hash to instantiate our BasicContractRef contract. Instantiating OtherContract through BasicContractRef​ We will first need to instantiate BasicContractRef. # In the `basic_contract_ref` directory cargo contract build cargo contract instantiate \\ --constructor new \\ --args 0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa \\ --suri //Alice --salt $(date +%s) If successful, this will output in a contract address for BasicContractRef similar to: Contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq Calling with OtherContract through BasicContractRef​ Finally, we can call the OtherContract methods through BasicContractRef as follows: cargo contract call --contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq \\ --message flip_and_get --suri //Alice --dry-run Which will result in something like: Result Success! Reverted false Data Ok(true) Builders​ The CreateBuilder and CallBuilder offer low-level, flexible interfaces for performing cross-contract calls. The CreateBuilder allows you to instantiate already uploaded contracts, and the CallBuilder allows you to call messages on instantiated contracts. CreateBuilder​ The CreateBuilder offers an an easy way for you to instantiate a contract. Note that you'll still need this contract to have been previously uploaded. note For a refresher on the difference between upload and instantiate see here. In order to instantiate a contract you need a reference to your contract, just like in the previous section. Below is an example of how to instantiate a contract using the CreateBuilder. We will: instantiate the uploaded contract with a code_hash of 0x4242... with no gas limit specified (0 means unlimited) sending 10 units of transferred value to the contract instance instantiating with the new constructor with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 generate the address (AccountId) using the specified salt_bytes and we expect it to return a value of type MyContractRef use contract::MyContractRef; let my_contract: MyContractRef = build_create::<MyContractRef>() .code_hash(Hash::from([0x42; 32])) .gas_limit(0) .endowment(10) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"new\"))) .push_arg(42) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .salt_bytes(&[0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF]) .returns::<MyContractRef>() .instantiate(); Since CreateBuilder::instantiate() returns a contract reference, we can use this contract reference to call messages just like in the previous section. CallBuilder​ The CallBuilder gives you a couple of ways to call messages from other contracts. There are two main approaches to this: Calls and DelegateCalls. We will briefly cover both here. CallBuilder: Call​ When using Calls the CallBuilder requires an already instantiated contract. We saw an example of how to use the CreateBuilder to instantiate contracts in the previous section. Below is an example of how to call a contract using the CallBuilder. We will: make a regular Call to a contract at the address 0x4242... with no gas limit specified (0 means unlimited) sending 10 units of transferred value to the contract instance calling the flip message with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 and we expect it to return a value of type bool let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .call(AccountId::from([0x42; 32])) .gas_limit(0) .transferred_value(10) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"flip\"))) .push_arg(42u8) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .returns::<bool>() .invoke(); Note: Message arguments will be encoded in the order in which they are provided to the CallBuilder. This means that they should match the order (and type) they appear in the function signature. You will not be able to get any feedback about this at compile time. You will only find out your call failed at runtime! CallBuilder: Delegate Call​ You can also use the CallBuilder to craft calls using DelegateCall mechanics. If you need a refresher on what delegate calls are, see this article. In the case of DelegateCalls, we don't require an already instantiated contract. We only need the code_hash of an uploaded contract. Below is an example of how to delegate call a contract using the CallBuilder. We will: make a DelegateCall to a contract with a code_hash (not contract address!) of 0x4242... calling the flip message with the following arguments a u8 with value 42 a bool with value true an array of 32 u8 with value 0x10 and we expect it to return an i32 let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(ink::primitives::Hash::from([0x42; 32])) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\"flip\"))) .push_arg(42u8) .push_arg(true) .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32]) ) .returns::<i32>() .invoke(); Builder Error Handling​ The CreateBuilder and the CallBuilder both offer error handling with the try_instantiate() and try_invoke() methods respectively. These allow contract developers to handle two types of errors: Errors from the underlying execution environment (e.g the Contracts pallet) Error from the programming language (e.g LangErrors) See the documentation for try_instantiate, try_invoke, ink::env::Error and ink::LangError for more details on proper error handling. tip Because the CallBuilder requires only a contract's AccountId and message selector, we can call Solidity contracts compiled using the Solang compiler and deployed to a chain that supports the pallet-contracts. See here for an example of how to do that. The reverse, calls from Solidity to ink!, are not supported by Solang, but there are plans to implement this in the future.

Mutable and Immutable Functions​ You may have noticed that the function template included self as the first parameter of the contract functions. It is through self that you gain access to all your contract functions and storage items. If you are simply reading from the contract storage, you only need to pass &self. But if you want to modify storage items, you will need to explicitly mark it as mutable, &mut self. impl MyContract { #[ink(message)] pub fn my_getter(&self) -> u32 { self.my_number } #[ink(message)] pub fn my_setter(&mut self, new_value: u32) { self.my_number = new_value; } } Edit this page Previous Reading Values from Storage Next Events Mutable and Immutable Functions","s":"Mutating Storage Values","u":"/basics/mutating-values","h":"","p":589},{"i":592,"t":"Basics Selectors Version: 4.x On this page Selectors Selectors in ink! are a language agnostic way of identifying constructors and messages. They are four-byte hexadecimal strings which look something like: 0x633aa551. You can find the selector of an ink! constructor or message in your contract metadata by looking for the selector field of the dispatchable you're interested in. Here is an example of how you can grab the message name and selector from your contract metadata using jq. cat target/ink/flipper.json | jq '.spec.messages[0] | \"\\(.label): \\(.selector)\"' \"flip: 0x633aa551\" Selector Calculation​ If you do not have access to a contract's metadata, you can also calculate it yourself. The algorithm ink! uses is fairly straightforward: Get just the name of the constructor or message Compute the BLAKE2 hash of the name Take the first four bytes of the hash as the selector Let's walk through a short example of what this looks like in practice. Consider the following message: #[ink(message)] fn frobinate(&mut self, fro: bool, bi: u32, nate: AccountId) -> bool { unimplemented!() } To calculate the selector we: Grab the name of the message, frobinate Compute BLAKE2(\"frobinate\") = 0x8e39d7f22ef4f9f1404fe5200768179a8b4f2b67799082d7b39f6a8ca82da8f1 Grab the first four bytes, 0x8e39d7f2 Selector Calculation: ink!

Furthermore, ink! provides substrate specific types like AccountId, Balance, and Hash to smart contracts as if they were primitive types. String, Vector and More​ The ink_prelude crate provides an efficient approach to import commonly used Rust types such as String and Vec, ensuring safe usage within an ink! contract. This simplifies the type referencing process between the std and no_std environments. Typically, these types are defined within the std crate in the std environment, and the alloc crate in the no_std environment. Given that ink! smart contract code is compiled in both environments (no_std for production and std for unit tests), developers might find themselves writing intricate conditional compilation macros. The ink_prelude crate conveniently re-exports these types, eliminating this complexity. You can use the prelude definitions like this: #[ink::contract] mod MyContractWithStringsAndArrays { use ink::prelude::string::String; use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store some String my_string: String, // Store some u32 in a vec my_vector: Vec<u32>, } /* --snip-- */ } Mapping​ ink! also provides a Mapping storage type. You can read more about it here. Substrate Types​ Here is an example of how you would store substrate types AccountId, Balance and Hash: #[ink::contract] mod MyContract { // Our struct will use those default ink! types #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store some AccountId my_account: AccountId, // Store some Balance my_balance: Balance, // Store some Hash my_hash: Hash, } /* --snip-- */ } Enum​ Enum can be used as a datatype as well. It's use in the example in the Struct section. pub enum Status { /// An auction has not started yet. NotStarted, /// We are in the starting period of the auction, collecting initial bids. OpeningPeriod, /// We are in the ending period of the auction, where we are taking snapshots /// of the winning bids. } Struct​ You can even combine all the above mentioned types in a custom struct which you can then store in the contract's storage. mod MyContract { use ink::prelude::string::String; use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; pub struct Auction { /// Branded name of the auction event. name: String, /// Some hash identifying the auction subject. subject: Hash, /// Auction status. status: Status, // Enum: Usage shown in next section /// Candle auction can have no winner. /// If auction is finalized, that means that the winner is determined. finalized: bool, /// vector vector: Vec<u8>, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { // Store Auctions in a vec auctions: Vec<Auction>, } } The values of an enum should be referenced as Status::OpeningPeriod. Initializing Storage in Constructors​ Constructors are how values get initialized. Every ink! smart contract must have a constructor which is run once when a contract is created. ink! smart contracts can have multiple constructors: Note that if you have a contract whose storage contains Mapping's you will need to use ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract in your constructor. See the Mapping documentation for more details. #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { number: u32, } impl MyContract { /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the given `init_value`. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self { Self { number: init_value, } } /// Constructor that initializes the `u32` value to the `u32` default. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn default() -> Self { Self { number: Default::default(), } } /* --snip-- */ } } Edit this page Previous Contract Template Next Reading Values from Storage Supported Types String, Vector and More Mapping Substrate Types Enum Struct Initializing Storage in Constructors","s":"Storing Values","u":"/basics/storing-values","h":"","p":593},{"i":596,"t":"Basics Trait Definitions Version: 4.x On this page Through the #[ink::trait_definition] proc. macro it is now possible to define your very own trait definitions that are then implementable by ink! smart contracts. This allows to define shared smart contract interfaces to different concrete implementations. Note that this ink! trait definition can be defined anywhere, even in another crate! See our ERC20-Trait example contract for an elaborate example which uses trait definitions. Example​ Defined in the base_erc20.rs module. #[ink::trait_definition] pub trait BaseErc20 { /// Returns the total supply. #[ink(message)] fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance; /// Transfers `amount` from caller to `to`. #[ink(message, payable)] fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance); } An ink! smart contract definition can then implement this trait definition as follows: #[ink::contract] mod erc20 { use base_erc20::BaseErc20; #[ink(storage)] pub struct Erc20 { total_supply: Balance, // more fields ... } impl Erc20 { /// Creates a new ERC-20 contract and initializes it with the initial supply for the instantiator. #[ink(constructor)] fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { // implementation ... } } impl BaseErc20 for Erc20 { #[ink(message)] fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { // implementation ... } #[ink(message, payable)] fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance) { // implementation ... } } } Calling the above Erc20 explicitly through its trait implementation can be done just as if it was normal Rust code: // --- Instantiating the ERC-20 contract: // let mut erc20 = <Erc20 as BaseErc20>::new(1000); // --- Is just the same as: use base_erc20::BaseErc20; let mut erc20 = Erc20::new(1000); // --- Retrieving the total supply: // assert_eq!(<Erc20 as BaseErc20>::total_supply(&erc20), 1000); // --- Is just the same as: use base_erc20::BaseErc20; assert_eq!(erc20.total_supply(), 1000); There are still many limitations to ink! trait definitions and trait implementations. For example, it is not possible to define associated constants or types or have default implemented methods. These limitations exist because of technical intricacies, however, please expect that many of those will be tackled in future ink! releases. Marks trait definitions to ink! as special ink! trait definitions. There are some restrictions that apply to ink! trait definitions that this macro checks. Also ink! trait definitions are required to have specialized structure so that the main #[ink::contract] macro can properly generate code for its implementations. Example: Definition type Balance = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Balance; #[ink::trait_definition] pub trait Erc20 { /// Returns the total supply of the ERC-20 smart contract. #[ink(message)] fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance; // etc. } Example: Implementation Given the above trait definition you can implement it as shown below: #[ink::contract] mod base_erc20 { /// We somehow cannot put the trait in the doc-test crate root due to bugs. #[ink_lang::trait_definition] pub trait Erc20 { /// Returns the total supply of the ERC-20 smart contract. #[ink(message)] fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance; } #[ink(storage)] pub struct BaseErc20 { total_supply: Balance, // etc .. } impl BaseErc20 { /// Constructs a new ERC-20 compliant smart contract using the initial supply. #[ink(constructor)] fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { Self { total_supply: initial_supply } } } impl Erc20 for BaseErc20 { /// Returns the total supply of the ERC-20 smart contract. #[ink(message)] fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { self.total_supply } // etc .. } } Edit this page Previous Selectors Next Cross-Contract Calling Example","s":"Example: Definition","u":"/basics/trait-definitions","h":"","p":595},{"i":598,"t":"Basics Reading Values from Storage Version: 4.x On this page Reading Values from Storage Reading from storage is where the fun begins!

The verification process for Rust-based smart contract languages is more complex than EVM-based languages such as Solidity due to the Rust compiler not providing deterministic builds of contracts. In order to verify an ink! smart contract, the verification process must recompile the contract in an identical host environment to which it was originally built. The simplest way to do this is using a Docker container. Since ink! 4.0.0, cargo-contract provides the necessary tools to produce a verifiable build and verify a binary against the reference contract. note Contract verification tools are currently available in cargo-contract version 4.0.0-alpha. To install it, run cargo install cargo-contract --locked --version 4.0.0-alpha Verifiable build​ As mentioned earlier, due to the non-deterministic nature of Rust compilation, smart contract developers are advised to build their project inside a Docker container we provide. Luckily, cargo contract build provides the --verifiable flag for this purpose. The steps for the verifiable build production are: Install Docker Engine (Linux users) Make sure you complete the post-installation step. This is required for the correct operation of the command. Ensure Docker Engine is up and running, and the socket is accessible. Simply run cargo contract build --verifiable. This will pull the image with the version that corresponds to your cargo-contract crate version, perform a build, and write artifacts in the standard output directory. If everything is correct, you can verify the image version in the metadata file. It should contain a key-value image after the contract information: \"contract\": { \"name\": \"flipper\", \"version\": \"4.3.0\", \"authors\": [ \"Parity Technologies <admin@parity.io>\" ] }, \"image\": \"paritytech/contracts-verifiable:4.0.0-alpha\", You are now ready to deploy your contract to a production chain. note The image is amd64 based. Therefore, the build times can be significantly slower on Apple Silicon machines. To overcome the issue enable Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation in Settings → Features in development tab in Docker Desktop App. Verifying contract​ Similarly to etherscan, you want to ensure that the given contract bundle is indeed a copy of some well-known contract code. There are two options when it comes to verification: Local bare-bones verification using cargo contract verify A third-party service Sirato cargo contract verify allows you to verify the given cargo project against a reference contract bundle. Simply run cargo contract verify <path> in the cargo project directory. If the reference contract was not build inside a docker container, the command will compare the build info from the reference contract with the current environment to ensure a match in environment. warning If you are not using standardized verifiable builds. It is your responsibility to ensure deterministic environment both for build and verification of smart contracts. If the build info from the .contract file matches the environment and a docker image is present in metadata, cargo contract will build the project inside the specified image docker container. Otherwise, a local build is carried out. Upon completion, the built contract bundle is compared to the reference one and the result is returned. Advanced usage​ If you would like to carry out other operations inside a deterministic environment you can use our docker image. It is availble on Docker Hub. The entry point is set to cargo contract allowing you to specify other commands to be executed. tip If you are building a multi-contract project, make sure you are executing the build in the parent directory in order to mount the directory of all contracts to be visible.

Metadata The ink! metadata is used to describe a contract in a language agnostic way. It is intended to be used by third party tools (e.g. UIs, block explorers) in order to correctly call contract functions and interpret events. The ink! metadata is generated when a contract is built using cargo-contract, e.g cargo contract build. The metadata can be found in your contract's target directory under the name <contract-name>.json. note The metadata is also contained in your <contract-name>.contract file. The difference is that the .contract file also contains the Wasm binary of your contract. <contract-name>.json​ The metadata is defined by the following required keys: source: Information about the contract's Wasm code. contract: Metadata about the contract. abi: Raw JSON of the contract's abi metadata, generated during contract compilation.

This can be used alongside the verifiable build image container to verify ink! smart contracts. The following steps outline how to create a verifiable build and subsequently verify it using these services. Performing a verifiable build​ You should already be familiar with using cargo-contract to compile your contract. You will need to install the ink! verified image crate: cargo install — git https://github.com/web3labs/ink-verifier-image.git You can now perform a verified build by running the following command in the smart contracts project folder: build-verifiable-ink -i ghcr.io/web3labs/ink-verifier . note Reproducable builds only work with cargo-contract >= 2.0.2 and contracts generated with that version onwards. To work around this you can use the signed metadata file instead. If you were to use the flipper example you would see output similar to the below: ... [5/5] Generating bundle Original wasm size: 20.6K, Optimized: 1.4K The contract was built in RELEASE mode. Your contract artifacts are ready.

There will now be a package zipfile available which contains the contract source code, metadata and Wasm binary: tree -L 3 . ├── Cargo.lock ├── Cargo.toml ├── lib.rs └── target └── ink └── package.zip Now that you have created the verified build, you can deploy your contract. Once deployed, you will need to make a note of the contract's code hash in order to verify it. Verifying an ink! smart contract​ Using the verification service web app​ The ink! Verification Service is a RESTful web service created for verifying smart contracts deployed using pallet-contracts. Web3 Labs host a public instance of the service at ink-verifier.sirato.xyz. A Swagger interface to the service is also avilable at ink-verifier.sirato.xyz/api/api-docs/. The verification process entails the following steps: A requestor uploads the source packge archive for a network and code hash The server checks that: The source code for the network and code hash is not already verified or being verified There is enough host resources to start a new verification The server downloads the pristine Wasm byte code correspondening to the provided network and code hash The server streams the archive if it is a compressed archive The server moves the staging files to the processing directory The server runs a container process for the verifier image to verify the package in processing. See source code verification workflow for details On the event of container exit the server moves the verified artificats to the publish directory if the verification was successful, otherwise keeps a log in the errors directory It works with any network that is defined in the @polkadot/apps-config package. In order to verify a deployed contract using the service you will need to use the /verify/{network}/{codeHash} endpoint which is documented here. Once a contract has been verified you can use the /contract/{codeHash}/metadata.json and /contract/{codeHash}/src endpoints to retrieve metadata and source code respectively. Using Sirato​ Sirato Substrate is a smart contract explorer for ink! smart contracts. It integrates with the contract verification service allowing users to upload package files generated by the verifiable build image via the Sirato UI instead of having to use the web endpoint. In addition once a contract has been verified, details of any contract activity and events taking place on a parachain or Substrate chain are decoded for the user in Sirato. For instance, in order to verify a contract deployed on the Rococo parachain, you can head to the Sirato instance at substrate.sirato.xyz. From there you can navigate to the deployed code by clicking on the Code reference that matches the code hash returned by the cargo contract instantiate call. Alternatively, you can navigate directly by entering the URL https://substrate.sirato.xyz/codes/0x<code-hash>. Now click on the source code tab: Then upload the verified package.zip file that you generated earlier. You can now start the verification process which kicks off a build of the provided resources. Once the process has finished you will see the message Contract successfully verified. Clicking Browse verified files will display the associated metadata and source files for your contract. If we then browse back to our contract instance, any methods or events will now be decoded. We can verify this by invoking a method on the contract. We can now see the decoded method that was called in Sirato. Unverified metadata upload​ The verification service supports uploading signed contract metadata as an additional alternative to reproducible builds generated metadata. Please note that the signed metadata is not verified and the owner of the code hash is trusted. This feature responds to: The support for build_info data is only available from cargo-contract 2.0.2. There is no official image or procedure regarding reproducible builds yet. We want to expand the service utility in the meantime. Although it is a far from ideal way to bind the metadata to a given code hash it prevents trivial exploitation by: Verifying that the signature is from the owner account of the code hash. Verifying that the signed message matches the sha256 of the uploaded metadata.json + the code hash of the uploaded contract bytecode. To provide signed metadata, you will need to use the /upload/{network}/{codeHash} endpoint which is documented here For the request body you will need to sign this message using the account that uploaded the contract. You can use the sign and verify tool in Polkadot.js. It is also possible to use Sirato for this, you can find instructions here.

Mapping. Here is an example of a mapping from a user to a Balance: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account. balances: ink::storage::Mapping<AccountId, Balance>, } This means that for a given key, you can store a unique instance of a value type. In this case, each \"user\" gets credited their own balance. Example: Using a Mapping​ The following example contract utilizes a Mapping so that anyone can deposit and withdraw balance for their own account: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { use ink::storage::Mapping; #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// Assign a balance to every account ID balances: Mapping<AccountId, Balance>, } impl MyContract { /// Constructor to initialize the contract with an empty mapping. #[ink(constructor, payable)] pub fn new() -> Self { let balances = Mapping::default(); Self { balances } } /// Retrieve the balance of the caller. #[ink(message)] pub fn get_balance(&self) -> Option<Balance> { let caller = self.env().caller(); self.balances.get(caller) } /// Credit more money to the contract. #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn transfer(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0); let endowment = self.env().transferred_value(); self.balances.insert(caller, &(balance + endowment)); } /// Withdraw all your balance from the contract. pub fn withdraw(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap(); self.balances.remove(caller); self.env().transfer(caller, balance).unwrap() } } } Considerations when using the Mapping type​ One of the main purposes of the ink! Mapping is to allow storing a lot of values. note There are many additional data structures accessible under ink::prelude::collections, such as HashMap or BTreeMap (to name a few). Note that these data structures all exhibit Packed storage loading behavior, as opposed to the ink! Mapping! Storage loading behavior​ Each Mapping value lives under it's own storage key. Briefly, this means that Mappings are lazily loaded in ink!. In other words, if your message only accesses a single key of a mapping, it will not load the whole mapping but only the value being accessed. // This causes only a single storage access and the decoding of a single \"MyValue\" struct, // no matter how many elements there are inside the mapping. let foo: MyValue = my_mapping.get(0)?; for n in 0..5 { // This causes a storage access and a decoding operation for each loop iteration. // It is not possible to \"fetch\" all key/value pairs directly at once. let bar: MyValue = my_mapping.get(n)?; } Furthermore, it follows that mapping values do not have a contiguous storage layout, and it is not possible to iterate over the contents of a map. Updating values​ The attentive reader may have noticed that accessing mapping values via the Mapping::get() method will result in an owned value (a local copy), as opposed to a direct reference into the storage. Changes to this value won't be reflected in the contract's storage \"automatically\". To avoid this common pitfall, the value must be inserted again at the same key after it was modified. The transfer function from above example illustrates this: pub fn transfer(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); // `balance` is a local value and not a reference to the value on storage! let balance = self.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0); let endowment = self.env().transferred_value(); // The following line of code would have no effect to the balance of the // caller stored in contract storage: // // balance += endowment; // // Instead, we use the `insert` function to write it back like so: self.balances.insert(caller, &(balance + endowment)); } Edit this page Previous Overview Next Storage Layout Example: Using a Mapping Considerations when using the Mapping type Storage loading behavior Updating values","s":"Working with Mapping","u":"/datastructures/mapping","h":"","p":615},{"i":618,"t":"Storage & Data Structures Overview Version: 4.x Overview The ink_storage crate acts as the standard storage library for ink! smart contracts. At the moment it provides two primitives for interacting with storage, Mapping and Lazy. Mapping is a mapping of key-value pairs directly to the contract storage. It is very similar to traditional hash tables and comparable to the mapping type Solidity offers. As a core ingredient to the ink! language, its main advantage is being simple and lightweight: It favors being efficient in terms of gas costs and code size over providing a lot of high-level functionality found in other implementations like the ink::prelude::collections::HashMap type. Overall, the ink! Mapping will be solid choice for most contracts. Moreover, smart contracts developers can implement advanced features themselves. Lazy is a wrapper type that can be used over any other storage compatible type. This allows smart contract developers fine-grained manual control over the layout of the contract storage by assigning a separate storage cell for the field. For example, it can be used to prevent the contract from eagerly loading large storage fields during each contract call. Conceivably, it may be desirable to change certain aspects on how your contract deals with its storage variables. You can find out more about this in the section about the ink! Storage Layout.

However, contract authors should know that they can also create their own custom data structures. Using custom types on storage​ Any custom type wanting to be compatible with ink! storage must implement the Storable trait, so it can be SCALE encoded and decoded. Additionally, the traits StorageLayout and TypeInfo are required as well. But don't worry, usually these traits can just be derived: /// A custom type that we can use in our contract storage #[derive(scale::Decode, scale::Encode)] #[cfg_attr( feature = \"std\", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo, ink::storage::traits::StorageLayout) )] pub struct Inner { value: bool, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct ContractStorage { inner: Inner, } Even better: there is a macro #[ink::storage_item], which derives all necessary traits for you. If there is no need to implement any special behavior, the above code example can be simplified further as follows: /// A custom type that we can use in our contract storage #[ink::storage_item] pub struct Inner { value: bool, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct ContractStorage { inner: Inner, } Naturally, you can as well implement any required trait manually. Please directly refer to the relevant trait documentations for more information. note The #[ink::storage_item] macro is responsible for storage key calculation of non-Packed types. Without it, the key for non-Packed fields will be zero. Using this macro is necessary if you don't plan to use a ManualKey on a non-Packed type. Types with custom implementations of the ink! storage traits can still use this macro only for key calculation by disabling the derives: #[ink::storage_item(derive = false)]. Generic storage fields​ It is possible to use generic data types in your storage, as long as any generic type satisfies the required storage trait bounds. In fact, we already witnessed this in the previous sections about the Mapping. Let's say you want a mapping where accessing a non-existent key should just return it's default value, akin to how mappings work in Solidity. Additionally, you want to know how many values there are in the mapping (its length). This could be implemented as a thin wrapper around the ink! Mapping as follows: /// Values for this map need to implement the `Default` trait. /// Naturally, they also must be compatible with contract storage. /// Note that the underlying `Mapping` type only supports `Packed` values. #[ink::storage_item] pub struct DefaultMap<K, V: Packed + Default> { values: Mapping<K, V>, length: u32, } impl<K: Encode, V: Packed + Default> DefaultMap<K, V> { /// Accessing non-existent keys will return the default value. pub fn get(&self, key: &K) -> V { self.values.get(key).unwrap_or_default() } /// Inserting into the map increases its length by one. pub fn set<I, U>(&mut self, key: I, value: &U) where I: scale::EncodeLike<K>, E: scale::EncodeLike<V> + Storable, { if self.values.insert(key, value).is_none() { self.length += 1 } } /// Removing a value from the map decreases its length by one. pub fn remove(&mut self, key: &K) { if self.values.take(key).is_some() { self.length -= 1 } } /// Return how many values the mapping contains pub fn len(&self) -> u32 { self.length } } /// `DefaultMap` is compatible with contract storage. #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { my_map: DefaultMap<BlockNumber, Balance>, } caution Generic data types may substantially increase your contracts overall code size, making it more costly to store on-chain.

Upgradeable Contracts Proxy Forwarding Properties Example Delegating execution to foreign Contract Code with delegate_call Properties Example Note on the usage of wildcard selectors Note on CallFlags Replacing Contract Code with set_code_hash() Properties Example Storage Compatibility A little note on the determinism of contract addresses Examples Proxy Forwarding​ This method relies on the ability of contracts to proxy calls to other contracts. Properties​ Forwards any call that does not match a selector of itself to another contract. The other contract needs to be deployed on-chain. State is stored in the storage of the contract to which calls are forwarded. User ---- tx ---> Proxy ----------> Implementation_v0 | ------------> Implementation_v1 | ------------> Implementation_v2 Example​ Our proxy contract will have these 2 storage fields: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Proxy { /// The `AccountId` of a contract where any call that does not match a /// selector of this contract is forwarded to. forward_to: AccountId, /// The `AccountId` of a privileged account that can update the /// forwarding address. This address is set to the account that /// instantiated this contract. admin: AccountId, } We then need a way to change the address of a contract to which we forward calls to and the actual message selector to proxy the call: impl Proxy { /// Changes the `AccountId` of the contract where any call that does /// not match a selector of this contract is forwarded to. /// /// # Note /// Only one extra message with a well-known selector `@` is allowed. #[ink(message, selector = @)] pub fn change_forward_address(&mut self, new_address: AccountId) { assert_eq!( self.env().caller(), self.admin, \"caller {:?} does not have sufficient permissions, only {:?} does\", self.env().caller(), self.admin, ); self.forward_to = new_address; } /// Fallback message for a contract call that doesn't match any /// of the other message selectors. /// /// # Note: /// /// - We allow payable messages here and would forward any optionally supplied /// value as well. /// - If the self receiver were `forward(&mut self)` here, this would not /// have any effect whatsoever on the contract we forward to. #[ink(message, payable, selector = _)] pub fn forward(&self) -> u32 { ink::env::call::build_call::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>() .call(self.forward_to) .transferred_value(self.env().transferred_value()) .call_flags( ink::env::CallFlags::default() .set_forward_input(true) .set_tail_call(true), ) .invoke() .unwrap_or_else(|err| { panic!( \"cross-contract call to {:?} failed due to {:?}\", self.forward_to, err ) }); unreachable!( \"the forwarded call will never return since `tail_call` was set\" ); } } tip Take a look at the selector pattern in the attribute macro: by declaring selector = _ we specify that all other messages should be handled by this message selector. Using this pattern, you can introduce other message to your proxy contract. Any messages that are not matched in the proxy contract will be forwarded to the specified contract address. Delegating execution to foreign Contract Code with delegate_call​ Similar to proxy-forwarding we can delegate execution to another code hash uploaded on-chain. Properties​ Delegates any call that does not match a selector of itself to another contract. Code is required to be uploaded on-chain, but is not required to be instantiated. State is stored in the storage of the original contract which submits the call. Storage layout must be identical between both contract codes. (Storage of Contract A) User ---- tx ---> Contract A ----------> Code_v0 | ^ | | ⌊_____________________⌋ Storage is delegated to Example​ Suppose we have defined of the caller contract as following: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Delegator { addresses: Mapping<AccountId, i32, ManualKey<0x23>>, counter: i32, } Then let's define two messages that separately calls to update addresses and counter separately: /// Increment the current value using delegate call. #[ink(message)] pub fn inc_delegate(&self, hash: Hash) { let selector = ink::selector_bytes!(\"inc\"); let _ = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(hash) // if the receiver is set to `&mut self`, // then any changes made in `inc_delegate()` before the delegate call // will be persisted, and any changes made within delegate call will be discarded. // Therefore, it is advised to use `&self` receiver with a mutating delegate call, // or `.set_tail_call(true)` to flag that any changes made by delegate call should be flushed into storage. // .call_flags(CallFlags::default().set_tail_call(true)) .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(selector))) .returns::<()>() .try_invoke(); } /// Adds entry to `addresses` using delegate call. /// Note that we don't need `set_tail_call(true)` flag /// because `Mapping` updates the storage instantly on-demand. #[ink(message)] pub fn add_entry_delegate(&mut self, hash: Hash) { let selector = ink::selector_bytes!(\"append_address_value\"); let _ = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>() .delegate(hash) .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(selector))) .returns::<()>() .try_invoke(); } ink! provides an intuitive call builder API for you to compose your call. As you can see that inc_delegate() can be built a call in slightly different manner than add_entry_delegate(). That's because if the delegated code modifies layout-full storage (i.e. it contains at least non-Lazy, non-Mapping field), either the receiver should be set to &self or the .set_tail_call(true) flag of CallFlags needs to be specified, and the storage layouts must match. This is due to the way ink! execution call stack is operated. Non-Lazy, non-Mapping field are first loaded into the memory. If &mut self receiver is used, then when delegate call is completed, the original state before the call will be persisted and flushed into the storage. Therefore, .set_tail_call(true) needs to be set to indicate that, that delegate call's storage context is the final (i.e. _tail) one that needs to be flushed. This also makes any code after the delegate call unreachable. With &self receiver, .set_tail_call(true) is not required since no storage flushing happens at the end of the original caller's function. (see Stack Exchange Answer for details on how changes are flushed into storage). Key compatibility If the delegated code modifies Lazy or Mapping field, the keys must be identical and .set_tail_call(true) is optional regardless of the function receiver. This is because Lazy and Mapping interact with the storage directly instead of loading and flushing storage states. Now let's look at the \"delegatee\" code: #[ink::contract] pub mod delegatee { use ink::storage::{ traits::ManualKey, Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] pub struct Delegatee { // `ManualKey` must be the same as in the original contract. addresses: Mapping<AccountId, i32, ManualKey<0x23>>, counter: i32, // Uncommenting below line will break storage compatibility. // flag: bool, } impl Delegatee { /// When using the delegate call. You only upload the code of the delegatee /// contract. However, the code and storage do not get initialized. /// /// Because of this. The constructor actually never gets called. #[allow(clippy::new_without_default)] #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { unreachable!( \"Constructors are not called when upgrading using `set_code_hash`.\" ) } /// Increments the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn inc(&mut self) { self.counter = self.counter.checked_add(2).unwrap(); } /// Adds current value of counter to the `addresses` #[ink(message)] pub fn append_address_value(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); self.addresses.insert(caller, &self.counter); } } } As you can see, delegatee's code looks like a normal ink! Smart Contract with some important features: Storage layout is identical to the original contract's storage addresses mapping key is identical Constructor does not have any logic, as the code is never instantiated. (It can be, but plays no effect on the execution) Note on the usage of wildcard selectors​ When working with cross-contract calls, developers are required to be aware of the some important changes. Since ink! 5 we have restricted the usage of the wildcard selector due to security reasons. Beware Due to IIP-2, ink! only allows to contain a single message with a well-known selector @ when the other message with the wildcard selector _ is defined. See example for illustration on how it can be used in practice. Note on CallFlags​ CallFlags provide fine-grained control over the cross-contract execution. Some useful properties: Re-entry is disable by default. It can be enabled with .set_allow_reentry(true) flag. The call execution context is returned to the caller by default. You can finish execution in the callee with .set_tail_call(true) flag. .set_clone_input(true) clones the input of the caller's messages. It can be used with when .set_tail_call(false). .set_forward_input(true) consumes the input of the caller's message which can be used after. It can be used with when .set_tail_call(true). Replacing Contract Code with set_code_hash()​ Following Substrate's runtime upgradeability philosophy, ink! also supports an easy way to update your contract code via the special function set_code_hash(). Properties​ Updates the contract code using set_code_hash(). This effectively replaces the code which is executed for the contract address. The other contract needs to be deployed on-chain. State is stored in the storage of the originally instantiated contract. Example​ Just add the following function to the contract you want to upgrade in the future. /// Modifies the code which is used to execute calls to this contract address (`AccountId`). /// /// We use this to upgrade the contract logic. We don't do any authorization here, any caller /// can execute this method. In a production contract you would do some authorization here. #[ink(message)] pub fn set_code(&mut self, code_hash: [u8; 32]) { ink::env::set_code_hash(&code_hash).unwrap_or_else(|err| { panic!( \"Failed to `set_code_hash` to {:?} due to {:?}\", code_hash, err ) }); ink::env::debug_println!(\"Switched code hash to {:?}.\", code_hash); } Storage Compatibility​ It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the new contract's storage is compatible with the storage of the contract that is replaced. Beware You should not change the order in which the contract state variables are declared, nor their type! Violating the restriction will not prevent a successful compilation, but will result in the mix-up of values or failure to read the storage correctly. This can be a result of severe errors in the application utilizing the contract. If the storage of your contract looks like this: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u32, y: bool, } The procedures listed below will make it invalid Changing the order of variables: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { y: bool, x: u32, } Removing an existing variable: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u32, } Changing the type of a variable: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { x: u64, y: bool, } Introducing a new variable before any of the existing ones: #[ink(storage)] pub struct YourContract { z: Vec<u32>, x: u32, y: bool, } A little note on the determinism of contract addresses​ note If your contract utilizes this approach, it no-longer holds a deterministic address assumption. You can no longer assume that a contract address identifies a specific code hash. Please refer to the issue for more details.

Let's dive deeper into the concepts behind ink! storage to get a better understanding of some of its implications and limitations. Storage Organization​ The following schema depicts the storage which is exposed to ink! by the contracts pallet: Storage data is always encoded with the SCALE codec. The storage API operates by storing and loading entries into and from a single storage cells, where each storage cell is accessed under its own dedicated storage key. To some extent, the storage API works similar to a traditional key-value database. Packed vs Non-Packed layout​ Types that can be stored entirely under a single storage cell are considered Packed. By default, ink! tries to store all storage struct fields under a single storage cell. Consequentially, with a Packed storage layout, any message interacting with the contract storage will always need to operate on the entire contract storage struct. For example, if we have a somewhat small contract storage struct consisting of only a few tiny fields, pulling everything from the storage inside every message is not problematic. It may even be advantageous - especially if we expect most messages to interact with most of the storage fields. On the other hand, this can get problematic if we're storing a large ink::prelude::vec::Vec in the contract storage but provide messages that do not need to read and write from this Vec. In that scenario, each and every contract message bears runtime overhead by dealing with that Vec, regardless whether they access it or not. This results in extra gas costs. To solve this problem we need to turn our storage into a non-packed layout somehow. caution If any type exhibiting Packed layout gets large enough (an ever-growing Vec might be a prime candidate for this), it will break your contract. This is because for encoding and decoding storage items, there is a buffer with only limited capacity (around 16KB in the default configuration) available. This means any contract trying to decode more than that will trap! If you are unsure about the potential size a data structure might get, consider using an ink! Mapping, which can store an arbitrary number of elements, instead. Eager Loading vs. Lazy Loading​ ink! provides means of breaking the storage up into smaller pieces, which can be loaded on demand, with the Lazy primitive. Wrapping any storage field inside a Lazy struct makes the storage struct in which that field appears also non-Packed, preventing it from being eagerly loaded during arbitrary storage operations: Note that in above illustration, the key of 0x12345678 just serves as an example; we'll learn more about storage key calculation later in this chapter. The following example demonstrates how we can solve the problem introduced in the above section. You'll notice that for the lazily loaded storage field, we now work with getters and setters to access and modify the underlying storage value: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { use ink::prelude::vec::Vec; use ink::storage::Lazy; #[derive(Default)] #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { tiny_value: Balance, /// This vector might get large and expensive to work with. /// We want to enforce a non-`Packed` storage layout. large_vec: Lazy<Vec<Balance>>, } impl MyContract { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self::default() } /// Because `large_vec` is loaded lazily, this message is always cheap. #[ink(message)] pub fn get_balance(&self) -> Balance { self.tiny_value } /// Lazy fields like `large_vec` provide `get()` and `set()` storage operators. #[ink(message)] pub fn add_balance(&mut self, value: Balance) { let mut balances = self.large_vec.get_or_default(); balances.push(value); self.large_vec.set(&balances); } } } caution ink::prelude::vec::Vec's are always loaded in their entirety. This is because all elements of the ink::prelude::vec::Vec live under a single storage key. Wrapping the ink::prelude::vec::Vec inside Lazy, like the provided example above does, has no influence on its inner layout. If you are dealing with large or sparse arrays on contract storage, consider using a Mapping instead. Manual vs. Automatic Key Generation​ By default, keys are calculated automatically for you, thanks to the AutoKey primitive. They'll be generated at compile time and ruled out for conflicts. However, for non-Packed types like Lazy or the Mapping, the ManualKey primitive allows manual control over the storage key of a field like so: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { /// The storage key for this field is always `0x0000007f` inner: Lazy<bool, ManualKey<127>>, } This may be advantageous: Your storage key will always stay the same, regardless of the version of your contract or ink! itself (note that the key calculation algorithm may change with future ink! versions). tip Using ManualKey instead of AutoKey might be especially desirable for upgradable contracts, as using AutoKey might result in a different storage key for the same field in a newer version of the contract. This may break your contract after an upgrade 😱! The storage key of the contracts root storage struct defaults to 0x00000000. However, contract developers can set the key to an arbitrary 4 bytes value by providing it a ManualKey like so: /// Manually set the root storage key of `MyContract` to be `0xcafebabe`. #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract<KEY: StorageKey = ManualKey<0xcafebabe>> { value: bool, } Considerations​ It might be worthwhile to think about the desired storage layout of your contract. While using a Packed layout will keep your contracts overall code size smaller, it can cause unnecessarily high gas costs. Thus, we consider it a good practice to break up large or complex storage layouts into reasonably sized distinct storage cells. note ink! Mappings are always non-Packed and loaded lazily, one key-value pair at the time.

On this page we outline how you can migrate existing clients and contracts from 3.x to 4.0. caution This migration guide is only for your code base! If you have an existing contract on-chain you cannot just upgrade the code on-chain ‒ you also have to migrate your data, since the way ink! 4.0 stores data and reads it (i.e. the storage layout) changes from ink! 3.x to 4.0. Compatibility​ ink! 4.0 is compatible with: Stable Rust >= 1.63.0 scale >=3 scale-info >= 2.3 pallet-contracts >= polkadot-v0.9.37 substrate-contracts-node >= v0.24.0 polkadot-js/api and polkadot-js/api-contract >= 9.10.2 cargo-contract 2.0​ Together with ink! 4.0 we've released cargo-contract 2.0. You have to use this latest version of cargo-contract for ink! 4.0 contracts. You can upgrade via: cargo install cargo-contract --force --version 2 Make sure that e.g. your CI also uses cargo-contract 2 with ink! 4. If you have wrapper scripts around cargo-contract you should ensure that this version is enforced, otherwise users will get an error. note cargo-contract no longer requires binaryen or wasm-opt as an external dependency. We required those because of wasm-opt tool (which is part of binaryen). Fortunately we were able to find a way of installing wasm-opt now as part of the cargo-contract installation process. Rust stable instead of nightly​ ink! 4.0 and cargo-contract use stable Rust now. This means no more cargo +nightly contract is required, you can just use a stable Rust toolchain now (>= Rust 1.63). New entrance ink crate​ The ink_lang crate has been replaced in #1223 by a new top level ink crate. All existing sub-crates are reexported and should be used via the new ink crate, so e.g. ink::env instead of ink_env. Contract authors should now import the top level ink crate instead of the individual crates. Migration​ In Cargo.toml Replace all individual ink_* crate dependencies with the ink crate. In the contract source: Remove the commonly used use ink_lang as ink idiom. Replace all usages of individual crates with reexports, e.g. ink_env ➜ ink::env. Storage API + Layout​ With #1331 the way ink! reads and writes to a contract's storage changed. Storage keys are generated at compile-time, and user facing abstractions which determine how contract data is laid out in storage are different now. Migration​ Initialize Mapping fields with Mapping::default() instead of ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract in constructors. See erc20 and other examples which use a Mapping. SpreadAllocate, SpreadLayout, PackedLayout, PackedAllocate have been removed. Removal of wee-alloc support​ ink! uses a bump allocator by default, additionally we supported another allocator (wee-alloc) through a feature flag. wee-alloc is no longer maintained and we removed support for it in #1403. Removal of eth_compatibility crate​ As part of #1233 the eth_compatibility crate was removed. The ecdsa_to_eth_address() function from it can now be found in the ink_env crate. ink_env::ecdsa_to_eth_address(&pub_key, &mut output); ink_storage::Mapping​ The function signature of Mapping::insert(key, val) changed to Mapping::insert(key, val) -> Option<u32>. The return value is the size of the pre-existing value at the specified key if any (in bytes). Two new useful functions were added: Mapping::contains(key) in #1224. Mapping::take() to get a value while removing it from storage in #1461. In case you were working around those two functions you can now use them directly; they are more gas-efficient than e.g. executing a get(key).is_none() instead of contains(key). Storage functions in ink_env​ As part of #1224 the return type of ink_env::set_contract_storage() was changed to return an Option<u32> instead of (). A new function ink_env::take_contract_storage was introduced. Removal of ink_env::random function​ We had to remove the ink_env::random function (in #1442). This function allowed contract developers getting random entropy. There is unfortunately no way how this can be done safely enough with built-in Substrate primitives on-chain currently. We're following the recommendation of our auditors to remove it. The alternative right now is to provide random entropy off-chain to the contract, to use a random entropy oracle, or to have a chain-extension that does this, in case the chain has a possibility to do so. We hope to bring this function back in a future release of ink!, the best hope right now is that it could come back with Sassafras, a block production protocol for future versions of Polkadot. If you're interested in more information on this check out the Substrate PR which deprecated the random interface of pallet-contracts. Constructors can now return Result<Self, MyContractError>​ With #1446 we introduced the possibility for constructors to return either Self (as usual) or Result<Self, MyContractError>. This enables contract developers to bubble up encoded error objects to clients/frontends about a failure. In ink! 3.x it was only possible to panic in the constructor in case an error occurred, resulting in loss of this information. Chain extension's returns_result removed​ The returns_result flag has been removed from the #[ink(extension = …)] attribute in #1569. We now infer this information at compile time. If handle_status is set to true, the return type will still be wrapped into Result as before. Contract Metadata (ABI)​ The most detailed way to grasp what changed is to look at this PR, which updated the metadata page in our documentation. Add support for language level errors (LangError)​ Under the hood, ink! now generates code that results in each message and constructor returning a Result<Message::Output, LangError> (or for constructors Result<Constructor::Output, LangError>). This happens even if the message/constructor doesn't have a return type, we default to the unit type () in that case. A LangError is a type of error which doesn't originate from the contract itself, nor from the underlying execution environment (so the Contracts pallet in this case). An example of where this would arise is if a caller tries to use a non-existent message selector for a contract. Previously, the contract would trap and not allow the caller to do any sort of error handling if it encountered a non-existent selector. This change doesn't affect how you write a contract! It affects clients and frontends though, since it breaks the API in two ways: first, all contract messages now have a Result return type, and second a new field, lang_error, will be introduced as part of the contract spec. The second change allows other languages (such as Solang) to use an equivalent LangError. Click here for a snippet of the new metadata for the Flipper contract. \"messages\": [ { \"args\": [], \"docs\": [ \" Flips the current value of the Flipper's boolean.\" ], \"label\": \"flip\", \"mutates\": true, \"payable\": false, \"returnType\": { \"displayName\": [ \"ink\", \"MessageResult\" ], \"type\": 1 }, \"selector\": \"0x633aa551\" }], \"lang_error\": { \"displayName\": [ \"ink\", \"LangError\" ], \"type\": 3 }, { \"id\": 3, \"type\": { \"def\": { \"variant\": { \"variants\": [ { \"index\": 1, \"name\": \"CouldNotReadInput\" } ] } }, \"path\": [ \"ink_primitives\", \"LangError\" ] } } Version field​ As part of #1313 the ink! ABI was changed to have a proper version field as part of the ink! metadata object. This enables querying the ABI version in a less-ambiguous way. Before: \"source\": {...}, \"contract\": {...}, \"V3\": { \"spec\": {...}, \"storage\": {...}, \"types\": {...} } After: { \"source\": {...}, \"contract\": {...}, \"spec\": {...}, \"storage\": {...}, \"types\": [...], \"version\": \"4\" } The Storage Layout (storage)​ The storage layout under the storage key changed for v4. If you have an application that is using it consider reading the updated documentation: General storage documentation Storage metadata format Removal of AccountId Default implementation​ In #1255 we removed the Default trait implementation on AccountIds. The Default implementation of AccountId returned the zero-address, which is problematic since the zero-address in the sr25519 and ed25519 curves has a known private key. Developers commonly reach for defaults, and the zero-address in particular, making it an unsafe trait implementation to have given the consequences. Imagine a developer sending tokens to the zero-address to be burned, only to find that they've been stolen because the private key is known. If you were previously using AccountId's Default implementation in your code you have a couple of different options for how to move forward. These will depend on what exactly you were using the zero-address for. If you were using it as a burn address: You can pick another address to use, assuming that you've actually picked a random address Consider a solution that involves reducing total issuance, instead of transferring tokens to a random address If you were using it as a privileged account: Change the account Add checks to ensure that calls coming from the zero-address are rejected You should also now consider dealing with AccountId's as Option<AccountId>'s. This is more idiomatic Rust, and also conveys the meaning of a \"null\" or \"empty\" address much better. Updates to the CallBuilder and CreateBuilder APIs​ There's been several changes to the CallBuilder and CreateBuilder APIs. In #1604 we renamed the CallBuilder::fire() method to CallBuilder::invoke(). This brings more consistency across our APIs which were already using the invoke terminology. In #1512 and #1525 we added support for handing LangErrors from the CreateBuilder and CallBuilder, respectively. If you want to handle errors from either Builder you can use the new CreateBuilder::try_instantiate() or CallBuilder::try_invoke() methods. Because of the addition of those methods we also removed any error handling from the non-try_ methods in #1602. This means that the CallBuilder::invoke() and CreateBuilder::instantiate() methods return values directly, and panic when they encounter an error. Lastly, in #1636 we added two methods to the CallBuilder to streamline Call and DelegateCall workflows: For Call you can use CallBuilder::call() (this replaces CallBuilder::callee()) For DelegateCall you can use CallBuilder::delegate() Removal of [lib.crate-type] and [lib.name] from contract manifest​ Earlier versions of cargo-contract required that these two fields were specified in the contract manifest explicitly, as follows: [lib] name = \"flipper\" path = \"lib.rs\" crate-type = [ # Used for normal contract Wasm blobs. \"cdylib\", # Use to generate ABI \"rlib\", ] However, with cargo-contract#929 we changed this behavior to: Use the contract name by default, removing the need for the name field Compile contracts as rlibs by default, and automatically changing to cdylib as needed This means that your new manifest should look like: [lib] path = \"lib.rs\" Edit this page Previous Frequently Asked Questions Next ink!

It allows third-party tooling to work with contract storage and can also help to better understand the storage layout of any given contract. Given a contract with the following storage: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { balance: Balance, block: BlockNumber, lazy: Lazy<bool>, } The storage will be reflected inside the metadata as like follows: \"root\": { \"layout\": { \"struct\": { \"fields\": [ { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0x00000000\", \"ty\": 0 } }, \"name\": \"balance\" }, { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0x00000000\", \"ty\": 1 } }, \"name\": \"block\" }, { \"layout\": { \"root\": { \"layout\": { \"leaf\": { \"key\": \"0xb1f4904e\", \"ty\": 2 } }, \"root_key\": \"0xb1f4904e\" } }, \"name\": \"lazy\" } ], \"name\": \"MyContract\" } }, \"root_key\": \"0x00000000\" } We observe that the storage layout is represented as a tree, where tangible storage values end up inside a leaf. Because of Packed encoding, leafs can share the same storage key, and in order to reach them you'd need to fetch and decode the whole storage cell under this key. A root_key is meant to either be used to directly access a Packed storage field or to serve as the base key for calculating the actual keys needed to access values in non-Packed fields (such as Mappings). Storage key calculation for ink! Mapping values​ Base storage keys are always 4 bytes in size. However, the storage API of the contracts pallet supports keys of arbitrary length. In order to reach a mapping value, the storage key of said value is calculated at runtime. The formula to calculate the base storage key S used to access a mapping value under the key K for a mapping with base key B can be expressed as follows: S = scale::encode(B) + scale::encode(K) Where the base key B is the root_key (of type u32) found in the contract metadata. In words, SCALE encode the base (root) key of the mapping and concatenate it with the SCALE encoded key of the mapped value to obtain the actual storage key used to access the mapped value. Given the following contract storage, which maps accounts to a balance: #[ink(storage)] pub struct Contract { roles: Mapping<AccountId, Balance, ManualKey<0x12345678>>, } Now let's suppose we are interested in finding the balance for the account 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY. The storage key is calculated as follows: SCALE encode the base key of the mapping (0x12345678u32), resulting in 0x78563412 SCALE encode the AccountId, which will be 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d. Note that you'll need to convert the SS58 into a AccountId32 first. Concatenating those two will result in the key 0x78563412d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d. let account_id = \"5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY\"; let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(account_id).unwrap(); let storage_key = &(0x12345678u32, account).encode(); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(storage_key)); // 0x78563412d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d Accessing storage items with the contractsApi runtime call API​ There are two ways to query for storage fields of smart contracts from outside a contract. Both methods are accessible via the polkadot-js web UI. The straight forward way to query a contracts storage is via a runtime API call, using the contractsApi endpoint provided by the contracts pallet. The endpoint provides a getStorage method, which just expects a contract address and a storage key as arguments. For example, to access the root storage struct under the key 0x00000000 of a contract, just specify the contract's address and the storage key 0x00000000 as-is. The API call will return the scale-encoded root storage struct of the contract. Accessing storage items with the childState RPC call API​ Under the hood, each contract gets its own child trie, where its storage items are actually stored. Additionally, the contracts pallet uses the Blake2 128 Concat Transparent hashing algorithm to calculate storage keys for any stored item inside the child trie. You'll need to account for that as well. With that in mind, to directly access storage items of any on-chain contract using a childState RPC call, you'll need the following: The child trie ID of the contract, represented as a PrefixedStorageKey The hashed storage key of the storage field Finding the contracts child trie ID​ The child trie ID is the Blake2_256 hash of the contracts instantiation nonce concatenated to it's AccountId. You can find it in polkadot-js chainstate query interface, where you need to execute the contracts_contractInfoOf state query. It can also be calculate manually according to the following code snippet. The instantiation note of the contract must be still be known. You can get it using the contracts_nonce chain state query in polkadot-js UI. use sp_core::crypto::Ss58Codec; use parity_scale_codec::Encode; // Given our contract ID is 5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4 let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(\"5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4\").unwrap(); // Given our instantiation nonce was 1 let nonce: u64 = 1; // The child trie ID can be calculated as follows: let trie_id = (&account, nonce).using_encoded(Blake2_256::hash); Calculate the PrefixedStorageKey from the child trie ID​ A PrefixedStorageKey based on the child trie ID can be constructed using the ChildInfo primitive as follows: use sp_core::storage::ChildInfo; let prefixed_storage_key = ChildInfo::new_default(&trie_id).into_prefixed_storage_key(); Calculate the storage key using transparent hashing​ Finally, we calculate the hashed storage key of the storage item we are wanting to access. The algorithm is simple: Blake2_128 hash the storage key and then concatenate the unhashed key to the hash. Given you want to access the storage item under the 0x00000000, it will look like this in code: use frame_support::Blake2_128Concat; // The base key is 0x00000000 let storage_key = Blake2_128Concat::hash(&[0, 0, 0, 0]); A full example​ Let's recap the last few paragraphs into a full example. Given: A contract at address 5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4 With instantiation nonce of 1 The root storage struct is to be found at base key 0x00000000 The following Rust program demonstrates how to calculate the PrefixedStorageKey of the contracts child trie, as well as the hashed key for the storage struct, which can then be used with the chilstate RPC endpoint function getStorage in polkadot-js to receive the root storage struct of the contract: use frame_support::{sp_runtime::AccountId32, Blake2_128Concat, Blake2_256, StorageHasher}; use parity_scale_codec::Encode; use sp_core::{crypto::Ss58Codec, storage::ChildInfo}; use std::ops::Deref; fn main() { // Find the child storage trie ID let account_id = \"5DjcHxSfjAgCTSF9mp6wQBJWBgj9h8uh57c7TNx1mL5hdQp4\"; let account: AccountId32 = Ss58Codec::from_string(account_id).unwrap(); let instantiation_nonce = 1u64; let trie_id = (account, instantiation_nonce).using_encoded(Blake2_256::hash); assert_eq!( hex::encode(trie_id), \"2fa252b7f996d28fd5d8b11098c09e56295eaf564299c6974421aa5ed887803b\" ); // Calculate the PrefixedStorageKey based on the trie ID let prefixed_storage_key = ChildInfo::new_default(&trie_id).into_prefixed_storage_key(); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(prefixed_storage_key.deref())); // 0x3a6368696c645f73746f726167653a64656661756c743a2fa252b7f996d28fd5d8b11098c09e56295eaf564299c6974421aa5ed887803b // Calculate the storage key using transparent hashing let storage_key = Blake2_128Concat::hash(&[0, 0, 0, 0]); println!(\"0x{}\", hex::encode(&storage_key)); // 0x11d2df4e979aa105cf552e9544ebd2b500000000 } Edit this page Previous Custom Data Structures Next Overview Storage key calculation for ink!

This experience can take many shapes from mobile app to interactive terminal applications. In this section we are focusing on the most prominent shape in web3 right now, web apps. Although we love Rust, the native language of the web is JavaScript. Thereby naturally the best tools for creating web experiences are available for JavaScript. Hence, the tools for smart contract interaction with JavaScript are the most advanced as well. To be precise all JavaScript tools mentioned here, actually leverage TypeScript to offer a JavaScript and a typesafe TypeScript experience. JavaScript/TypeScript Tools​ There are several levels of abstraction where you can start your journey creating a web frontend for your contracts. Each levels offers different advantages and disadvantages. The following list is of tools. They are sorted from the most generic no third party library way to interact with Polkadot's smart contracts to the most opinionated template using libraries and proven frontend frameworks. Using no libraries​ RPC Interface (not recommended): nodes participating in the blockchain network offer an JSON RPC interface to interact with the blockchains state and capabilities. Low level libraries​ @polkadot/api (not recommended): allows for most general interaction with Polkadot-SDK based blockchains from JavaScript. In order to talk to smart-contracts, one would use the pallet-contracts runtime calls. @polkadot/api-contract (recommended): abstraction on top of @polkadot/api for the pallet-contracts. Makes interaction with smart contracts more comfortable and type safe. React​ useInkathon (recommended): A hooks library for the popular frontend javascript framework React with focus on smart-contract interactions. Built using @polkadot/api & @polkadot/api-contract. React and Next.js​ inkathon (recommended): Full Stack web app template using the popular full stack template Nextjs. Itself is using useInkathon.

These examples not only offer the smart contract code but also have an accompanied frontend project. Checkout the README.md for details how to setup and run these frontend examples. Other Languages​ Of course the browser and JavaScript should not be the one and only platform for smart contract frontends. It's just the most mature for smart contract frontend tooling.

In the next section we will start a Substrate Smart Contracts node and configure the Contracts UI to interact with it. Debug vs. Release Build​ By default, cargo-contract builds the contract in debug mode. This means that the contract will e.g. print statements like ink::env::debug_println!(\"magic number: {}\", value); to the node's console if debugging was enabled on the node (instructions here). To support functionality like this the debug build of a contract includes some heavy-weight logic. For contracts that are supposed to run in production you should always build the contract with --release: cargo contract build --release This will ensure that nothing unnecessary is compiled into the Wasm blob, making your contract faster and cheaper to deploy and execute. info With this behavior cargo-contract mirrors how cargo behaves for Rust programs: the --release flag has to be passed explicitly to cargo build.

Analyzer Version: 4.x On this page ink! Analyzer ink! analyzer is a collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools for semantic analysis of ink! smart contract code. ink! analyzer aims to improve ink! language support in integrated development environments (IDEs), source code editors and other development tools by providing modular and reusable building blocks for implementing language features (e.g. diagnostic errors, quick fixes, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content e.t.c) for the ink! programming language. Semantic Analyzer (source code, crates.io, docs.rs). Language Server (source code, binary/executable releases, crates.io, docs.rs). Visual Studio Code Extension (source code, VS Code Marketplace listing, VSIX releases). Problem​ While ink! developers can leverage Rust tooling and excellent IDE/code editor support via rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust because \"ink! is just standard Rust in a well-defined \"contract format\" with specialized #[ink(…)] attribute macros\", relying on only generic Rust language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools has some significant limitations for the developer experience including: No language support (e.g. diagnostic errors/warnings and quick fixes) for ink!'s domain specific semantic rules for smart contracts (e.g. exactly one #[ink(storage)] struct, at least one #[ink(message)] method and the same for #[ink(constructor)], ink! attributes should be applied to items of the correct type e.t.c). Inconsistent editor experience with issues like no code completion and/or hover content for some ink! attribute arguments (e.g #[ink(payable)]) because macro expansion/name resolution and trait resolution are hard problems for generic IDE/code editor tools (see also https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2021/11/21/ides-and-macros.html). No language support (e.g. go to definition, find references and rename/refactor) for ink! specific syntax like paths in ink! attribute argument values (e.g. env values). Solution​ To solve the above challenges and improve ink! language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools, ink! analyzer creates two main components: A modular domain-specific semantic analysis library for ink! built on a resilient and lossless parser. A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation built on top of the aforementioned semantic analysis library. These two components can be reused to add ink! language support to multiple IDEs, code editors and other development tools. In particular, a large number of IDEs and code editors support LSP servers either via configurable LSP clients or robust LSP client libraries/APIs/modules, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, Acme, Lapce, Eclipse and many more. ink! analyzer makes it relatively easy for: Users to enable ink! language support for their IDE, code editor or other development tool if it has either a native/built-in or third-party LSP client that can be configured to launch an LSP server using an executable command (i.e. the path to an installed ink! Language Server binary) and can use stdio (standard in/standard out) as the message transport. Developers to either build extensions/plugins/integrations that add ink! language support to any tool with robust LSP client libraries/APIs/modules, or add first-class ink! language support to an existing LSP client (e.g. an open-source extension/plugin/integration). In addition to distributing compiled ink! Language Server (ink-lsp-server) binaries for most of the major platforms/architectures, ink! analyzer additionally distributes a Visual Studio Code extension that ships with a bundled ink! Language Server as a showcase and reference implementation for the latter use case.

Flipper only has two functions: flip() and get(). We will show you what it's like to play with both of them. RPC calls vs. Transactions​ There are two ways of calling a contract: Dry-run via RPC​ Remote procedure calls, or RPC methods, are a way for an external program – for example, a browser or front-end application – to communicate with a Substrate node. For example, you might use an RPC method to read a stored value, submit a transaction, or request information about the chain a node is connected to. If a user interface displays the value of a contract (e.g. the balance of an account in an ERC-20 contract), then this is typically done via RPC. Specifically it is done by executing a synchronous dry-run of the contract method and returning its result. The following schema depicts this. RPC calls don't require any tokens, they just require a connection to a node in the network. It's important to note that the execution won't result in any state mutations on the blockchain, it really just is a dry-run. State mutating via submitting a Transaction​ The other method of executing a call to a contract is by submitting a transaction on-chain. This requires tokens of the network to pay for the cost of the transaction. The transaction will be put in a transaction pool and asynchronously processed. The important implication here is that during submission of the transaction no result is available. This is different from an RPC call. The typical pattern for how a client can recognize the result of the contract call is to have the contract emit an event and have the client actively listen for such an event. Typically libraries (like polkadot-js/api) provide API functions to do just that. The important take-away is that contract developers have to make sure that events are emitted if they want clients to be able to pick up on them. Using the Contracts UI​ 1. get() function​ We set the initial value of the Flipper contract value to false when we instantiated the contract. Let's check that this is the case. In the Message to Send section, select the \"get(): bool\" message and accept the default values for the other options. Press \"Read\" and confirm that it returns the value false: 2. flip() function​ So let's make the value turn true now! The alternative message to send with the UI is flip().

Squink is the mascot of ink! and guides new users and adventurers through our presentations workshops and tutorials. It also has a romance with Rust's mascot, Ferris. Generally it is very friendly and open to learning new Rustaceans but be aware to never upset it by taking away dots from the word ink! by spelling it incorrectly! It really is into dots. Stories tell that it demanded the spelling of ink! with as many dots as possible. Is it \"ink\" or \"ink!\"? What does the \"!\" stand for? The correct spelling is ink! ‒ with a lowercase \"i\" and an exclamation mark at the end. The history here is that: …in the very first iteration ink! was originally a declarative Rust macro. A contract was invoked by writing ink!{ … }. …there is a real-world analogy here of writing a paper contract using ink. …we wanted to have as many DOTs as possible in the name 😉. …the symmetry of the top and bottom dot of i and ! is aesthetically pleasing 🌻. So please don't make poor Squink cry having to read !ink, ink, Ink!, or Ink. What's ink!'s relationship to Substrate/Polkadot?​ Substrate is a modular framework to build decentralized applications on top of blockchain technology. Polkadot is a layer-0 blockchain built using Substrate that allows to orchestrate an entire fleet of other blockchains to join forces and communicate with each other. Blockchains built with Substrate can include the so-called pallet-contracts module in order to allow instantiating and executing smart contracts. ink! was built to allow users to write smart contracts in Rust targeting blockchains built by Substrate that have the aforementioned pallet-contracts included. While ink! is currently the most advanced smart contract language targeting Substrate blockchains it is not the only possible choice for users. There is also a Solidity to Wasm compiler called Solang that also allows to target Substrate chains and there are other languages in plan and discovery phase for the same purpose. On the Substrate side the same is true for the pallet-contracts. It is just a module that defines the basic set of features required for executing smart contracts on the blockchain that includes it. However, it is not necessarily the only solution to do exactly that. There is also the evm-pallet to run smart contracts targeting the EVM as well as the experimental actors-pallet that allows to execute smart contracts written in the actor style programming model. Over time the Substrate community might come up with yet other pallets for smart contracts execution. Please see our page How it Works – Substrate for more information. How to call other smart contracts on the same blockchain?​ See the Cross-contract calling section. How to call other smart contracts on another parachain?​ This feature has not yet been implemented by the Substrate side. What is a contract's ABI or Metadata?​ In ink! a smart contract's metadata is retrieved by using the cargo-contract CLI tool and invoking cargo contract build which outputs a .contract file that includes both the compiled .wasm of the ink! smart contract as well as the so-called metadata information of the same smart contract. The metadata is especially important for third party tools such as Polkadot JS Apps or the Contracts UI and provides useful information about the contract's constructors, messages, events, function selectors, documentation and comments of the aforementioned structures as well as how inputs and outputs shall be encoded and decoded respectively etc. Can a re-entrancy bug occur in ink! contracts?​ Yes. However, the Substrate team is well aware of the associated problems and already through about possible future additions to eliminate re-entrancy attacks. How can my smart contract interact with the runtime?​ See the Chain Extensions section for more information. How can I use ink! with a Substrate chain with a custom chain config?​ Please see the env_types argument for the contract macro. It allows you to specify your environment a la #[ink::contract(env = MyEnvironment)]. What does the #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] at the beginning of each contract mean?​ The #[cfg(..)] or #[cfg_attr(..)] annotations are how Rust does conditional compilation. ink! smart contracts can be compiled in two different modes. Through #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] an ink! smart contract tells the Rust compiler in which mode they are being compiled. This also plays a significant role in how ink! generates the smart contract code. The two modes are as follows: Wasm mode: This is the mode chosen when compiling an ink! smart contract for deployment on a blockchain. The resulting binary is a .wasm file and as such it is not possible to use certain parts of Rust's standard library. Off-chain mode: This is the mode chosen when trying to test an ink! smart contract using the off-chain environment. Off-chain environment testing is very useful to check if certain ink! constructors or messages are well behaving and allow for better debuggability than when trying to debug the same smart contract deployed on a chain. Overflow Safety?​ Being written in Rust, ink! can provide compile-time overflow/underflow safety. Using a Rust compiler configuration, you can specify whether you want to support overflowing math, or if you want contract execution to panic when overflows occur. No need to continually import \"Safe Math\" libraries, although Rust also provides integrated checked, wrapped, and saturated math functions. note There are some known issues regarding functionality of compiler level overflow checks and the resulting size of the Wasm blob. This feature may change or be iterated on in the future. What is the difference between memory and storage?​ In ink!, memory refers to computer memory, while storage refers to the on-chain storage used by a contract instance. Memory is temporary and only lasts until the contract execution is done, while storage is persistent and lasts over many contract executions. The contract storage is built on top of the runtime storage, and access is considered to be slow. How do I print something to the console from the runtime?​ Please see our page on Contract Debugging. Why is Rust's standard library (stdlib) not available in ink!?​ Rust's standard library consists of three different layers: core library which defines everything that has no dependencies outside of Rust itself. Included are types such as Option, Result as well as a whole variety of modules, functions and macro. ink! smart contracts allow authors to use Rust's core crate. alloc library which is depending on a global allocator and mainly defines collections that spill their elements on to the execution's heap memory. Examples for collections are Box, String, Vec, HashMap, LinkedList and modules such as fmt, rc (ref-counted pointers) or borrows. ink! smart contracts allow authors to use Rust's alloc crate. By default ink! authors use definitions from the alloc crate through ink::prelude crate. std library is what people generally call Rust's standard library. The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the broader Rust ecosystem. It requires several operating system capabilities in order to work correctly such as input and output systems for files, networking etc. Since the Wasm (a.k.a. wasm32-unknown-unknown) compilation target does not support Rust's standard library ink! authors cannot use it either for their own purposes. Instead the pallet-contracts tries to provide some common functionality that would otherwise be missing for common smart contract operations. How do I hash a value?​ A number of crypto hashes are built into the pallet-contracts and therefore very efficient to use. We currently support a handful of those, you can view the complete list here. If you have the urgent need for another crypto hash you could introduce it through Chain Extensions or make a proposal to include it into the default set of the pallet-contracts. Using one of the built-in crypto hashes can be done as explained here: self.env().hash_bytes() self.env().hash_encoded() Why is it not possible to use floating point data types in ink!? How do I implement returning a decimal number?​ Floats are cool for all kinds of reasons, but they also have one important drawback. Floating point arithmetic is non-deterministic which means that different processors compute (slightly) different results for the same operation. Although there is an IEEE spec, non-determinism can come from specific libraries used, or even hardware. In order for the nodes in a blockchain network to reach agreement on the state of the chain, all operations must be completely deterministic. Hence we don't allow floating point data types in ink!. Consequently it's not possible to return a decimal number from an ink! message. What you should do instead is to have your user interface denominate the returned number to decimals. Note, that it's typical for blockchains to have the number of available tokens defined as a non-floating number and determine the denomination in the user interface. For example, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to the smallest unit of 100,000,000 Satoshi and all Bitcoin implementations internally persist account balances in Satoshi, not as a decimal number of Bitcoin. Why can't I just use the standard Rust data collections in ink!?​ You can use them! They are exposed via the ink_prelude crate (e.g. ink::prelude::vec::Vec) and you can return them from ink! messages and also persist them to storage. However, the Rust stdlib collections are not optimized for smart contract usage! So for example, if you use them to persist your data on the chain they will always occupy a single storage cell and thus always be loaded eagerly, in their entirety. This can be very costly! Just think about a Vec or a HashMap where the smart contract might only need access to a few elements, rather than the entire data collection. Why am I getting a ContractTrapped error when interacting with a contract?​ When it does not constitute a deliberate assertion, like for example a permission check, it is most likely a bug in your contract or in ink!. A common source of ContractTrapped are Integer overflows, those can cause your contract to trap as well. There is a known bug in the Rust compiler with respect to safe math operations. As a workaround for this particular bug try to insert overflow-checks = false into your Cargo.toml. This will disable safe math operations altogether, but unfortunately we are currently not aware of a better workaround until the bug in the compiler is fixed. If you don't find the issue you can also ask for help in our public Element or Discord channel. What are the scale::Encode and scale::Decode traits?​ Substrate-based blockchains use the SCALE codec to encode data. As a consequence the data for every interaction with Substrate needs to be SCALE-encodable ‒ i.e. it needs to implement either scale::Encode, scale::Decode, or both. This affects e.g. data you want to return to a caller, data that you want to take as input, or data you want to store on-chain. A common error you might get when a necessary SCALE trait is not implemented for a data structure could be along the lines of the trait \"WrapperTypeEncode\" is not implemented for \"Foo\". For example, you might encounter this error if you try to store a custom data structure in the contract's storage. Or e.g. when attempting to return a custom error from an ink! message. note The error the trait \"WrapperTypeEncode\" is not implemented for … is also a common error when a mismatching version of parity-scale-codec is used in the contract opposed to the version used by ink!. The solution typically is to add a fitting implementation of the trait for your data structure: Encode is used for encoding a data structure when it is e.g. returned to a caller or when it is persisted to the contracts storage. Decode is used for the inverse, e.g. when reading from storage or taking an input from a user (or another contract). It's possible to derive those traits and oftentimes the simplest way is to just derive the missing trait for the object for which its implementation is missing: #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode)] struct MyCustomDataStructure { … } How do I use String in my contract?​ In general, you should think twice if you really need String. Smart contracts usually don't use strings; those are typically used for user interactions and should live in your UI and not on the chain. Minimizing storage usage of your contract is a best practice and you should only persist items which you need to derive state transitions in your contract. If you still, for some reason, need to use String, then you should use the String from the ink! prelude.

Smart contract deployment on Substrate is a little different than on traditional smart contract blockchains. Whereas a completely new blob of smart contract source code is deployed each time you push a contract on other platforms, Substrate opts to optimize this behavior. For example, the standard ERC20 token has been deployed to Ethereum thousands of times, sometimes only with changes to the initial configuration (through the Solidity constructor function). Each of these instances take up space on the blockchain equivalent to the contract source code size, even though no code was actually changed. In Substrate, the contract deployment process is split into two steps: Putting your contract code on the blockchain Creating an instance of your contract With this pattern, contract code like the ERC20 standard can be put on the blockchain one single time, but instantiated any number of times. No need to continually upload the same source code over and waste space on the blockchain. Using the Contracts UI​ 1. Upload Contract Code​ Here we will upload the contract code and instantiate one copy of the contract on the blockchain (which is usually why we upload the contract code in the first place): Go to https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/ Click the Add New Contract button in the sidebar. Click the Upload New Contract Code button in the Add New Contract page. Choose an Instantiation account (e.g. ALICE). Give the contract a descriptive Name (e.g. Flipper Contract). Drag the flipper.contract file that contains the bundled Wasm blob and metadata into the drag & drop area. You will see the UI parse the metadata and enabling the button that takes you to the next step. Click the Next button 2. Instantiate a Contract on the Blockchain​ Smart contracts exist as an extension of the account system on the blockchain. Thus creating an instance of this contract will create a new AccountId which will store any balance managed by the smart contract and allow us to interact with the contract. Now a screen displays the information that represents our smart contract. We are going to instantiate a copy of the smart contract: Accept the default options for the contract Deployment Constructor. Accept the default options Max Gas Allowed of 200000. Click on Next The transaction is now queued, review your data and click Upload and Instantiate or go back and modify your inputs. When you click Upload and Instantiate you should see the extrinsic instantiateWithCode is processing, and a flurry of events appear including the creation of a new account (system.NewAccount) and the instantiation of the contract (contracts.Instantiated). You will be redirected to a new page, where you can interact with the newly created contract instance. Using cargo-contract​ Contracts can be deployed via the command-line as well.

This means that if you deploy a contract using the UI, and then purge your Substrate node, you will be prompted to reset your local storage and please do so. And then re-deploy any contracts and re-do any steps that you may have done before on your node. Other Issues​ If you run into any other issues during this tutorial, please report an issue!

Installation​ Download Binary​ The easiest method of installation is by downloading and executing a precompiled binary from the Release Page Build Locally​ If you would like to build the source locally, you should first complete the basic Rust setup instructions. Once Rust is installed and configured, you will be able to build the node with: cargo build --release Embedded Docs :book:​ Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands: ./target/release/swanky-node -h Usage​ This command will start the single-node development chain with a persistent state. ./target/release/swanky-node If you would prefer to run the node in non-persistent mode, use tmp option. ./target/release/swanky-node --tmp # or ./target/release/swanky-node --dev Purge the development chain's state. ./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain Development Accounts​ The alice development account will be the authority and sudo account as declared in the genesis state. While at the same time, the following accounts will be pre-funded: Alice Bob Charlie Dave Eve Ferdie Alice//stash Bob//stash Charlie//stash Dave//stash Eve//stash Ferdie//stash Show only Errors and Contract Debug Output​ To print errors and contract debug output to the console log, supply -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug when starting the node. ./target/release/swanky-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug Important: Debug output is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests ‒ not for transactions. See the ink! FAQ for more details: How do I print something to the console from the runtime?. Connect with Polkadot.js Apps Portal​ Once the Swanky Node is running locally, you will be able to connect to it from the Polkadot-JS Apps front-end, in order to interact with your chain. Click here connecting the Apps to your local Swanky Node. Run in Docker​ First, install Docker and Docker Compose. Then run the following command to start a single node development chain. mkdir .local # this is mounted by container ./scripts/docker_run.sh This command will compile the code, and then start a local development network. You can also replace the default command (cargo build --release && ./target/release/swanky-node --dev --ws-external) by appending your own. A few useful commands are shown below: # Run Substrate node without re-compiling ./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node --ws-external # Purge the local dev chain ./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain # Check whether the code is compilable ./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check Consensus (Manual Seal & Instant Seal)​ Unlike other blockchains, Swanky Node adopts block authoring and finality gadgets referred to as Manual Seal and Instant Seal, consensus mechanisms suitable for contract development and testing. Manual seal - Blocks are authored whenever RPC is called. Instant seal - Blocks are authored as soon as transactions enter the pool, most often resulting in one transaction per block. Swanky Node enables both Manual seal and Instant seal. Manual Sealing via RPC call​ We can tell the node to author a block by calling the engine_createBlock RPC. $ curl http://localhost:9933 -H \"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\":\"engine_createBlock\", \"params\": [true, false, null] }' Params​ Create Empty create_empty is a Boolean value indicating whether empty blocks may be created. Setting create-empty to true does not mean that an empty block will necessarily be created. Rather, it means that the engine should go ahead creating a block even if no transactions are present. If transactions are present in the queue, they will be included regardless of the value of create_empty. Finalize finalize is a Boolean value indicating whether the block (and its ancestors, recursively) should be finalized after creation. Parent Hash parent_hash is an optional hash of a block to use as a parent. To set the parent, use the format \"0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764\". To omit the parent, use null. When the parent is omitted the block will be built on the current best block. Manually specifying the parent is useful for constructing fork scenarios, and demonstrating chain reorganizations. Finalizing Blocks Manually​ In addition to finalizing blocks at the time of creating them, they may also be finalized later by using the RPC call engine_finalizeBlock. $ curl http://localhost:9933 -H \"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\":\"engine_finalizeBlock\", \"params\": [\"0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764\", null] }' Edit this page Previous Swanky CLI Next ink!

It aims to ease development of and interaction with Wasm smart contracts and provides simple tools to bootstrap contract environment (project) with contract and integration tests templates, manage local node and accounts, language agnostic compile, deploy contracts to both local and remote networks, compatibility checks between the contract pallet and compiler... With all of the features mentioned above, even more is in active or planned development. The whole project is public, and everyone is welcome to contribute or suggest features: Swanky CLI repo Swanky CLI project info Templates provided in the current version of swanky-cli, as well as environment and supported tools target ink! v4, and use cargo contract v2 Installing​ The CLI can be installed and used in different ways: using a preconfigured environment of a dev-container downloading a precompiled binary as an npm package caution Note that using the precompiled binaries, NPM, or compiling it yourself requires you to have the local environment set up correctly Dev container (Recommended)​ Using dev container is the recommended method to use swanky-cli, it includes all the environment setup and will support auto-updates in the future. To run your project in the dev container follow the steps on swanky-dev-container Github. Download the precompiled binaries​ Download the correct archive for your platform from the releases section of swanky-cli github page. Extract the archive to the appropriate location, for example the software directory. Add the swanky executable to your path variable by creating a symbolic link to it from a common bin directory or somewhere similar. MacOS Debian/Ubuntu ln -s /Users/my_name/software/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin ln -s /home/my_name/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin Globally with npm​ This approach may seem simpler, but due to the nature of Node.js dependency management, may result in version inconsistency or other errors. $ npm install -g @astar-network/swanky-cli or $ npx @astar-network/swanky-cli [command] Using swanky-cli​ If you're using a dev container, or have followed the installation instructions, you should have swanky command available in your terminal. Running it without any arguments (or with -h/--help) will provide you with a list of top-level commands and the app version. Passing help as an argument and providing it -n/--nested-commands flag will show full list of commands, including nested ones: swanky help --nested-commands Full list of commands Note that every command and subcommand also supports -h/--help flags to display their usage instructions. Likewise, most of the commands support -v /--verbose flag, which you can use to get more detailed output (useful for debugging and reporting errors). Bootstrap a new project​ Using the swanky init command, you'll be prompted for a series of answers to define your project and the first smart contract within it. After gathering all the required information, the app will proceed to check your environment, scaffold the project, download and install (optionally) swanky node and the project dependencies. swanky init PROJECT_NAME Init process The resulting folder structure should look something like this: Folder structure Resources: swanky init command usage manual available templates Check dependencies and compatibility​ You can quickly check the presence and versions of required dependencies by running swanky check command. Verify dependencies info For now, you will need to be be in a project folder to run this command. This command will be updated to fix that, and provide more useful information. Resources: swanky check command usage manual Manage accounts​ Create and list accounts used for contract interaction. These are the accounts stored inside your swanky.config.json, so the command needs to be ran from within the project directory. During account creation you'll have an option of passing your own mnemonic, or have Swanky generate one for you by passing -g flag. You can also mark the account as \"production\" which will require you to set a password and encrypt the mnemonic. Be careful not to use a dev account on live networks, as their mnemonic is stored in plain text in the config! Creating and listing accounts tip Newly generated accounts that are not the preconfigured dev accounts (Alice, Bob, Charlie...) will have no funds initially, so you'll have to transfer some manually. Resources: swanky account command usage manual Interact with contracts​ swanky contract command offers several subcommands for different interactions with your contracts. Different `contract` subcommands The command names are self explanatory, and to get more detailed information on using a specific command, you can use the help flag with it: swanky contract SUB_COMMAND --help Compile​ Depending on the contracts definition in swanky.config.json, calling swanky contract compile CONTRACT_NAME will run either cargo-contract or ask! compiler (via npm script). If you have multiple contracts and wish to compile them all at once, you can pass the --all flag instead of the contract name. Likewise, if you're compiling for production, you need to pass the --prod flag. Compile all contracts Resources: swanky account command usage manual Get detailed contract description​ Compiling the contract will generate it's metadata too. Swanky provides contract explain CONTRACT_NAME command to get a more human friendly version of that metadata: Getting contract metadata information Resources: contract compile command usage manual Run E2E tests​ You can test your contracts using Mocha framework and Chai assertions. note Please note these tests are not ink! E2E tests, but are written in TypeScript, and require a local node to be running. You can get more information on ink! E2E test framework in the ink! documentation. A contract template will provide you with a simple test as well, which you can use as a starting point. The tests utilize @polkadot/api library, and contract types generated by typechain-polkadot. The types are generated during the compile step and copied to test/*/typedContract/ directory, along with the contract artifacts in the test/*/artifacts/ directory. If you need only the types generated (if you for example deleted or edited them), you can do that without going through the whole compilation step by using swanky contract typegen command. Running swanky contract test CONTRACT_NAME will detect all *.test.ts files in the test/contract_name/ directory, and run them sequentially, or in all directories inside test/ if you pass the -a/--all flag. Run tests for a contract tip Running the tests programmatically may throw warnings about duplicate dependencies on @polkadot/* libraries. This occurs because those libraries are included in swanky app itself, as well as in the test files. Apart from the warning text spamming, no negative consequence of this has been observed. If you want to avoid the warnings anyway, you can run tests as a yarn/npm command: yarn test or npm run test Web based report will be generated and stored in artifacts/ directory. You can copy the path of the reports and use the serve app to view them in browser. (serve is included in swanky-dev-container) serve PATH_TO_REPORTS Web based test report Resources: swanky contract test command usage manual Deploy your contract​ When your contract is compiled and tested, you can deploy it to a local node or a remote network. You will need to supply account you wish to deploy the contract from (-account), max amount of gas to be used (-g), and any arguments required by your contract's constructor (-a). By default, your contract will be deployed to a local node, but you can pass a custom network via -n/--network flag. Available networks are configured in swanky.config.json file. Deploying the contract Successfully running the deploy command will print out the address your contract is deployed to, as well as save it into swanky.config.json Resources: swanky contract deploy command usage manual Run queries and transactions​ Once your contract is deployed, you can call it from the CLI using query or tx commands. Use query for read-only calls, and tx for the calls that change the chain state and require signing (and a gas fee). Both commands require CONTRACT_NAME and MESSAGE_NAME parameters, and for tx a caller account needs to be provided too. (-a/--account). If the message you're calling requires arguments to be passed, you can do that using -p/--param flag. Calling a query on a contract Calling a transaction on a contract Result of a query is straight forward, OK followed by what ever the response is. The transaction (tx) is a bit more raw though. Important to note are the dispatchError and internalError fields, plus the status field. If the errors are undefined, and the status finalized, your transaction has been successful. tip Gas fee for tx is calculated and applied automatically, but you can provide a gas limit manually by using the -g/--gas flag. Keep in mind that the transaction will fail if you provide too low a value. Resources: swanky contract query command usage manual swanky contract tx command usage manual Add a new contract from template​ You can create additional contracts in the same project, using the contract new command and selecting from predefined templates. The contract will be referred by name when using the relevant contract commands, and you can check the details in swanky.config.json Adding a new contract Resources: swanky contract new command usage manual Interact with a local node​ If you have chosen to download and use the Swanky Node during init step, you can use swanky node commands to start and manage it. Simply running swanky node start will start the node, and the node will preserve the state across restarts. If you want to reset the node state, use the swanky node purge command. Starting the swanky node info Note that node needs to be running if you are using a default local network with deploy, query and tx commands. caution If you want to use an external UI to interact with the node, you might run into some CORS issues. This can be solved by passing a custom array of whitelisted urls using the --rpcCors flag. Resources: swanky node commands usage manual Using plugins​ Swanky CLI's functionality can be extended by the use of plugins, and it's a way to add new, case specific commands without modifying the core codebase.

It provides standard contracts based on Polkadot Standard Proposals (PSPs), as well as higher-level contracts and Rust macros that generate ink! code. Using OpenBrush is simple, you only add the dependency to your Cargo.toml file. You can find an example here. Which standards and contract components does it contain?​ PSP22: Fungible Token (ERC20 equivalent) with extensions. PSP34: Non-Fungible Token (ERC721 equivalent) with extensions. PSP37: ERC1155 equivalent with extensions. Ownable Restrict access to action for non-owners. Access Control: Define a set of roles and restrict access to an action by roles. Reentrancy Guard: Prevent reentrant calls to a function. Pausable: Pause/Unpause the contract to disable/enable some operations. Timelock Controller: Execute transactions with some delay. Payment Splitter: Split the amount of native tokens between participants. Generic Trait Implementation​ OpenBrush adds support for generic Trait implementations, so that you can split a Trait and its implementation into different files. This can increase the readability and maintainability of your smart-contract code base (detailed description). Wrapper around Traits: #[openbrush::wrapper]​ If you know that the other contract implements a trait and the trait is attributed with #[openbrush::trait_definition] you only need that trait definition and the address of the other contract in order to call a method from the deployed third-party contract. The wrapper is an attribute macro named #[openbrush::wrapper] for traits. It will generate a callable structure of the other contract with the name defined by a user: // You can create wrapper in the place where you defined the trait // Or if you import **everything** from the file where you define trait #[openbrush::wrapper] type Trait1Ref = dyn Trait1; The benefits of such mechanism is a functional polymorphism. Instead of working with the concrete implementation of the trait as a dependency in you contract, you only interact with its interface. That means that you do not need to import other contracts as dependencies to the calling contract. If you need to update the implementation of the trait within the calling contract, you only need to replace the called contract address. The wrapper does not guarantee that the given address refers to a contract that implements the given trait. Additionally, the wrapper supports multiple traits (i.e. dyn Erc20 + Ownable + Erc721) without losing the syntax highlighting from your favourite IDE. See this example for more information. Documentation​ OpenBrush Github repo Official Docs OpenBrush website Substrate Seminar (Youtube) How to use modifiers Typechain-Polkadot​ Another tool helpful for ink! smart contracts development is Typechain-Polkadot. Typechain-Polkadot is used to generate Typescript wrappers around your smart contract. This can be used for UI development or in integration tests of your ink! smart contracts. The library uses polkadot-js/api under the hood, but is especially useful because all calls and queries are typed, therefore the chance of getting some error during a call is mitigated. Sol2Ink​ Sol2Ink is a tool which can support migrations from Solidity to ink!. Solidity code is passed to Sol2Ink and converted to an ink! contract. The tool can also be used to learn the differences between Solidity and ink! code.

It is an opinionated language that we have built by extending the popular Rust programming language with functionality needed to make it smart contract compatible. How does ink! tie into Substrate?​ Substrate is a framework for building blockchains – those can be standalone blockchains or blockchains connected to Kusama or Polkadot, so called parachains. Substrate contains a number of modules, in Substrate terminology those are called pallets. Substrate comes with a set of pallets for many requirements modern blockchains typically have – staking, fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, governance, etc. Substrate also ships with a module for smart contracts, this module is called pallet-contracts. If a parachain is developed in Substrate it can easily add smart contract functionality by including this pallet. How does ink! come into play here? ink! is a programming language, specifically it is an embedded domain-specific language for the popular Rust programming language. This means that you can use all the normal Rust syntax plus some specifics that we added to make the language suitable for the smart contract world. The pallet-contracts takes these ink! contracts and executes them safely. So in short: with ink! you can write smart contracts in Rust for blockchains built with Substrate that include pallet-contracts. How does the pallet-contracts work?​ We intentionally designed pallet-contracts in a way that it is decoupled from the language that is used to write smart contracts. The pallet is only the execution environment and it takes WebAssembly files as input. Smart contracts for this pallet have to be compiled to the WebAssembly (Wasm) target architecture. For contract developers this means they can use ink! for writing smart contracts, but can also decide on other languages. Right now three languages to choose from exist: Parity's ink! for Rust. ask! for AssemblyScript. The Solang compiler for Solidity. It's not hard to add new languages. There just needs to be a compiler for the language down to WebAssembly, then it's possible to implement the API of pallet-contracts. This API at the moment consists of about 50 functions for anything a smart contract may desire: storage access, cryptographic functionality, environmental information like block numbers, access to functions for getting random numbers or self-terminate the contract, etc. Not all of those have to be implemented in the language ‒ the ink! \"Hello, World!\" requires just six API functions. The following schema depicts this relationship: We think this design is more future-proof than some architectures found in competing ecosystems. There is no tight coupling between language and execution environment. WebAssembly is an industry standard and a multitude of programming languages can nowadays be compiled down to WebAssembly. If in, say ten years time, researchers come up with an innovative language for writing smart contracts (or a subset of an existing language) then as long as there is a WebAssembly compiler it will be easy to make this language compatible with pallet-contracts. Why include pallet-contracts on a parachain?​ There are a couple use cases for including smart contract functionality on a parachain. We distinguish three big ones. Use Case 1: Smart Contracts as \"first-class citizens\"​ The most obvious use case is a parachain which provides smart contracts as a “first-class citizen”, meaning smart contracts are the central value proposition of the chain. Those chains typically take the off-the-shelf pallet-contracts and create some additional innovation on top of it. Examples of this are: Astar: a parachain team that has built a layer on top of pallet-contracts so that contract developers can earn a passive income whenever their contracts are being used. Phala: a parachain team that utilizes pallet-contracts in a trusted execution environment, enabling confidential smart contract execution and interoperability. Aleph Zero: uses the pallet-contracts in a zero-knowledge context. t3rn: uses pallet-contracts as a building block to enable multi-chain execution for smart contracts. Use Case 2: Smart Contracts as \"second-class citizens\"​ There is another not so obvious use case for pallet-contracts: smart contracts as “second-class citizens” on an existing chain. By this we mean that the central value proposition of the chain has nothing to do with smart contracts, but it still includes them as an add-on. We provide an API (called chain extensions) with which a parachain can expose certain parts of its business logic to smart contract developers. Through this, smart contract developers can utilize the business logic primitives of the chain to build a new application on top of it. Think for example of a decentralized exchange blockchain. This chain would in its simplest form have an order book to place bids and asks ‒ there is no need for taking untrusted, Turing-complete, programs from the outside. The parachain could decide to expose the order book into smart contracts though, giving external developers the option of building new applications that utilize the order book. For example, to upload trading algorithms as smart contracts to the chain. Smart contracts here are an opportunity to up the user engagement and drive usage of the chain's native token. And the billing for utilizing the chain comes already built-in with the pallet ‒ users have to pay gas fees for the execution of their smart contract. Use Case 3: Smart Contracts as a first step into Polkadot or Kusama​ A third big use case for pallet-contracts is to prototype an idea as a proof-of-concept smart contract before leasing a dedicated parachain slot on Polkadot or Kusama. The time to develop a smart contract and deploy it is shorter than the onboarding story for a parachain. One can deploy a proof-of-concept smart contract first, see if it gains traction and the idea holds up to the real world. Only subsequently, once there is a need for e.g. cheaper transaction fees, more efficient execution, or a governance mechanism for the community, the smart contract could be migrated to a dedicated parachain runtime with its own slot. ink! contracts and Substrate runtimes are both written in Rust and share similar primitives, this enables a clear path to graduate from a smart contract to its own runtime. Developers can reuse large parts of their code, their tests, as well as frontend and client code. Smart Contracts vs. Parachains​ One of the first questions we typically get when somebody learns about Substrate, Polkadot, or Kusama is when to develop a parachain vs. when to develop a smart contract. The distinction here is that in the context of Polkadot and Kusama a parachain leases a slot for a couple of months for up to two years. The deal with a lease is that the parachain gets a fixed slot for executing its business logic (typically referred to as its state transition function) and can persist its modified state in a block. In Substrate terminology this state transition function is called the chain's runtime. The distinction to other ecosystems here is that, in the context of Polkadot, parachains and smart contracts exist at different layers of the stack: smart contracts sit on top of parachains. Parachains would usually be described as layer-1 blockchains ‒ except for that they don't have to build their own security, are upgradable, and interoperable. It's noteworthy that a parachain's state transition function doesn't get further validated ‒ it's up to the parachain how it utilizes its slot time. The parachain already pre-paid for its slot when it won the slot auction on Polkadot or Kusama. This means the parachain can build its own (blockchain) world! For example, it can decide on how transaction fees are charged ‒ or even if transaction fees are charged at all. These options are crucial when building new or more user-friendly business models. Other distinguishing factors between parachains that we observe in the wild are differences in how governance works or the crypto-economics. There are some constraints on how the parachain can build its world though. Like physics in the real world it has to adhere to certain ground rules. For Polkadot and Kusama that's for example the consensus algorithm for the Relay Chain to communicate with the parachain. From those ground rules the advantages of Polkadot and Kusama emerge. Advantages like the aforementioned shared security, cross-chain communication, or guaranteed execution slot time. For smart contracts, on the other hand, an existing parachain has to include the pallet-contracts for users to deploy smart contracts. The deployed smart contract is always untrusted code. Anyone (or any program) that has tokens of the chain can upload a smart contract without requiring permission. Smart contracts allow permissionless deployment of untrusted programs on a blockchain. The pallet-contracts has to assume that these programs are adversarial, it has to put a number of safety pillars in place to ensure that the contract can not e.g. stall the chain or cause state corruption of other contracts. For pallet-contracts those safety pillars include mechanisms like gas metering or deposits for storing data on-chain. To restate this important distinction: developing a parachain runtime is different from developing a smart contract ‒ a smart contract sits on top of a parachain. The trade-off is that with a parachain one has the freedom to decide on (nearly) all the rules that make up the parachain. With a smart contract one is constrained by what the chain allows and the safety pillars that necessarily have to be in place. A smart contract can never be as fast as a native pallet built in the parachain runtime ‒ there is too much logic in between. A smart contract on the other hand has less friction for developing and deploying it. Developers don't have to take care of governance, crypto-economics, etc. One just needs a few tokens and can go on its merry way deploying a smart contract. It's as simple as that.

Architecture​ CosmWasm is modular, meaning that any blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can add smart contract support to their chain. That is similar to the Substrate approach, where chains have the option to add pallet-contracts to their runtime. Aside from that, the architecture philosophy is likely the point where CosmWasm and ink! differ the most. CosmWasm follows the actor model design pattern, while ink! follows a synchronous execution model. That means some fundamental differences in how the source code is structured. The main entry point functions of CosmWasm contracts are: instantiate which bootstraps the initial contract state (assuming it's already been deployed). execute which has the actor perform operations to its internal state. query which retrieves data from the actor’s internal state. An ink! contract can have as many public dispatchables as the developer desires, and differently from CosmWasm, it doesn’t rely on JSON schemas for defining how the messages are structured. Instead, ink! makes heavy usage of Rust macros. The main ink! macros are: #[ink(constructor)] which is called when the contract is deployed, and is responsible for bootstrapping the initial contract state into the storage. It is analogous to the CosmWasm instantiate function. #[ink(storage)] which annotates a struct that represents the contract's internal state. #[ink(message)] which marks a function as a public dispatchable, meaning that it is exposed in the contract interface to the outside world. This macro can make a function behave analogously to CosmWasm’s execute and query functions. This depends on how it affects the internal contract state and what the return types. #[ink(event)] and #[ink(topic)] which annotates a struct and its members as the events and topics that the contract might emit. There are other ink! macros, for which details can be found at Macros & Attributes. Unit Testing​ Unit testing in CosmWasm is quite similar to ink!. Both use the conventional Rust #[cfg(test)] macro and set up a mock on-chain environment. While CosmWasm unit tests have different modules for each of the three main entry-point functions, ink! allows for a more generalised approach, where the #[ink(test)] macro is used for each unit test. You can read more about ink! unit tests here. Compiler​ CosmWasm uses cargo-wasm as its main compiler, while ink! uses cargo-contract. cargo-contract is developed by Parity specifically for building, testing, and deploying ink! contracts. Local Development Network In terms of local development networks, the cosmos/gaia repository acts as the basic template for a generic Cosmos node. With the addition of the x/wasm module and some clean-up, this template repository becomes wasmd, the entry point for CosmWasm development. In terms of Substrate, substrate-node-template is a basic generic template of a node. Similar to x/wasm, pallet-contracts is the module that adds WebAssembly smart contract functionality to the chain. Parity provides the substrate-contracts-node, which is analogous to wasmd - a basic template node for smart contract development. Testnets​ For CosmWasm development and on-chain testing, wasmd can be operated as a local setup (single or multiple nodes), or connected to the cliffnet public test network. ink! contracts can be deployed on a few different options: Locally, on a single or multiple node setup of substrate-contracts-node. Contracts on Rococo Parachain, which is connected to the Rococo relay chain test network. Astar Network’s Shibuya testnet. Development Workflow​ Dependencies​ The first step in CosmWasm development is to install dependencies, namely Go, Rust and wasmd. For ink! you can also find a setup guide which will help you with dependencies, namely Rust, cargo-contract and substrate-contracts-node. Environment Setup​ The next step in the CosmWasm development workflow is setting up the environment. That consists mainly of configuring wasmd such that it has prefunded accounts that are able to interact with the network. When substrate-contracts-node is started, it already contains well known pre-funded accounts (alice, bob, etc.) which are ready to be used for development. Compile and Test​ CosmWasm provides example contracts at the cw-contracts repository. After the repository is cloned, from the contract directory it can be compiled via: $ cargo wasm and tested via: $ cargo unit-test Similarly, ink! provides an examples directory of its main repository. A contract can be compiled from its directory via: $ cargo contract build and tested via: $ cargo test Deploy and Interact​ CosmWasm contracts are deployed and instantiated with help of the wasmd executable. The list of step is provided here. It is possible to deploy and interact with ink! contracts using either a CLI (cargo-contract), or a web UI (contracts-ui).

This is especially useful for user defined events. The signature of the event is by default one of the topics of the event, except if you annotate the event with #[ink(anonymous)].

It is notable that the collections under ink_storage ‒ such as e.g. Vec or HashMap ‒ don't implement scale::Encode. This means you can't just return a Vec from an ink! message. This restriction is intentional ‒ returning a complete data structure with a potentially unbounded content is an anti-pattern for smart contracts. Just think about the unpredictable gas costs. If you really really need to return a data structure in its entirety then use the ones from ink_prelude (e.g. ink_prelude::vec::Vec). Those implement scale::Encode.

By default ink! creates a selector for each message and constructor. This is necessary since the contract is compiled to a Wasm blob and functions are invoked by invoking the selector, which identifies a method ‒ method names are no longer available in these underlying layers. Using this attribute it is possible to specify a concrete dispatch selector for the flagged entity. This allows a contract author to precisely control the selectors of their APIs making it possible to rename their API without breakage. A selector must be a u32 decodable integer. For example selector = 0xCAFEBABE selector = 42 An exception is the fallback selector _, allowing contract calls not matching any of the other message selectors to be dispatched to a fallback message. Fallback messages can be payable. Examples​ #[ink(message, selector = 0xC0DECAFE)] fn my_message_1(&self) {} #[ink(message, selector = 42)] fn my_message_2(&self) {} #[ink(message, payable, selector = _)] fn my_fallback(&self) {} … then the selector of my_message_1 is [0xC0, 0xDE, 0xCA, 0xFE] and the selector of my_message_2 is [0, 0, 0, 42] since setting the selector manually overrides the automatically generated selector. Controlling the messages selector​ Every ink! message and ink! constructor has a selector with which the message or constructor can be uniquely identified within the ink! smart contract. Non-unique message or constructor selector lead to a compile time error. These selectors are mainly used to drive the contract's dispatch upon calling it. An ink! smart contract author can control the selector of an ink! message or ink! constructor using the selector flag. An example is shown below: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] #[ink(selector = 0xDEADBEEF)] // Works on constructors as well. pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: initial_value } } #[ink(message)] #[ink(selector = 0xCAFEBABE)] // You can either specify selector out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } #[ink(message, selector = 0xC0DECAFE)] // ...or specify the selector inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Edit this page Previous #[ink(payable)] Next #[ink(storage)] Examples Controlling the messages selector","s":"#[ink(selector = S:u32)] | ink! documentation","u":"/macros-attributes/selector","h":"","p":691},{"i":694,"t":"Macros & Attributes #[ink(payable)] Version: 4.x On this page Applicable to ink! messages.

If you are a beginner trying to learn ink! we recommend you to check out our extensive ink! workshop. Description​ The macro does analysis on the provided smart contract code and generates proper code. Usage​ Header Arguments​ The #[ink::contract] macro can be provided with some additional comma-separated header arguments: compile_as_dependency: bool​ Tells the ink! code generator to always or never compile the smart contract as if it was used as a dependency of another ink! smart contract. Normally this flag is only really useful for ink! developers who want to inspect code generation of ink! smart contracts. The author is not aware of any particular practical use case for users that makes use of this flag but contract writers are encouraged to disprove this. Note that it is recommended to make use of the built-in crate feature ink-as-dependency to flag smart contract dependencies listed in a contract's Cargo.toml as actual dependencies to ink!. Usage Example: #[ink::contract(compile_as_dependency = true)] mod my_contract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyStorage; impl MyStorage { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { MyStorage {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } // ... } Default value: Depends on the crate feature propagation of Cargo.toml. env: impl Environment​ Tells the ink! code generator which environment to use for the ink! smart contract. The environment must implement the Environment (defined in ink_env) trait and provides all the necessary fundamental type definitions for Balance, AccountId etc. When using a custom Environment implementation for a smart contract all types that it exposes to the ink! smart contract and the mirrored types used in the runtime must be aligned with respect to SCALE encoding and semantics. Usage Example: Given a custom Environment implementation: pub struct MyEnvironment; impl ink::env::Environment for MyEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 3; type AccountId = u64; type Balance = u128; type Hash = [u8; 32]; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = ::ink::env::NoChainExtension; } A user might implement their ink! smart contract using the above custom Environment implementation as demonstrated below: #[ink::contract(env = MyEnvironment)] mod my_contract { pub struct MyEnvironment; impl ink::env::Environment for MyEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = 3; type AccountId = u64; type Balance = u128; type Hash = [u8; 32]; type Timestamp = u64; type BlockNumber = u32; type ChainExtension = ::ink::env::NoChainExtension; } #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyStorage; impl MyStorage { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { MyStorage {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } // ... } Default value: DefaultEnvironment defined in ink_env crate. Analysis​ The #[ink::contract] macro fully analyses its input smart contract against invalid arguments and structure. Some example rules include but are not limited to: There must be exactly one #[ink(storage)] struct. This struct defines the layout of the storage that the ink! smart contract operates on. The user is able to use a variety of built-in facilities, combine them in various ways or even provide their own implementations of storage data structures. For more information visit the ink_storage crate documentation. Example: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn construct() -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } } There must be at least one #[ink(constructor)] defined method. Methods flagged with #[ink(constructor)] are special in that they are dispatchable upon contract instantiation. A contract may define multiple such constructors which allow users of the contract to instantiate a contract in multiple different ways. Example: Given the Flipper contract definition above we add an #[ink(constructor)] as follows: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } #[ink(message)] pub fn message(&self) {} } } There must be at least one #[ink(message)] defined method. Methods flagged with #[ink(message)] are special in that they are dispatchable upon contract invocation. The set of ink! messages defined for an ink! smart contract define its API surface with which users are allowed to interact. An ink! smart contract can have multiple such ink! messages defined. Note: An ink! message with a &self receiver may only read state whereas an ink! message with a &mut self receiver may mutate the contract's storage. Example: Given the Flipper contract definition above we add some #[ink(message)] definitions as follows: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message)] pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Payable Messages: An ink! message by default will reject calls that additional fund the smart contract. Authors of ink! smart contracts can make an ink! message payable by adding the payable flag to it. An example below: Note that ink! constructors are always implicitly payable and thus cannot be flagged as such. #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] #[ink(payable)] // You can either specify payable out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message, payable)] // ...or specify payable inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Controlling the messages selector: Every ink! message and ink! constructor has a unique selector with which the message or constructor can be uniquely identified within the ink! smart contract. These selectors are mainly used to drive the contract's dispatch upon calling it. An ink! smart contract author can control the selector of an ink! message or ink! constructor using the selector flag. An example is shown below: #[ink::contract] mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { #[ink(constructor)] #[ink(selector = \"0xDEADBEEF\")] // Works on constructors as well. pub fn new(initial_value: bool) -> Self { Flipper { value: false } } /// Flips the current value. #[ink(message)] #[ink(selector = \"0xCAFEBABE\")] // You can either specify selector out-of-line. pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value. #[ink(message, selector = \"0xFEEDBEEF\")] // ...or specify selector inline. pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Interacting with the Contract Executor​ The ink_env crate provides facilities to interact with the contract executor that connects ink! smart contracts with the outer world. For example it is possible to query the current call's caller via: use ink_env; ink::env::test::run_test::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment, _>(|_| { let caller = ink::env::caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); let _caller = caller; Ok(()) }).unwrap(); However, ink! provides a much simpler way to interact with the contract executor via its environment accessor. An example below: #[ink::contract] mod greeter { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Greeter; impl Greeter { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); let message = format!(\"thanks for instantiation {:?}\", caller); ink::env::debug_println(&message); Greeter {} } #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn fund(&mut self) { let caller = self.env().caller(); let value = self.env().transferred_balance(); let message = format!(\"thanks for the funding of {:?} from {:?}\", value, caller); ink::env::debug_println(&message); } } } Events​ An ink! smart contract may define events that it can emit during contract execution. Emitting events can be used by third party tools to query information about a contract's execution and state. The following example ink! contract shows how an event Transferred is defined and emitted in the #[ink(constructor)]. #[ink::contract] mod erc20 { /// Defines an event that is emitted every time value is transferred. #[ink(event)] pub struct Transferred { from: Option<AccountId>, to: Option<AccountId>, value: Balance, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Erc20 { total_supply: Balance, // more fields ... } impl Erc20 { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self { let caller = Self::env().caller(); Self::env().emit_event(Transferred { from: None, to: Some(caller), value: initial_supply, }); Self { total_supply: initial_supply } } #[ink(message)] pub fn total_supply(&self) -> Balance { self.total_supply } } } Example: Flipper​ The below code shows the complete implementation of the so-called Flipper ink! smart contract. For us it acts as the \"Hello, World!\" of the ink! smart contracts because it is minimal while still providing some more or less useful functionality. It controls a single bool value that can be either false or true and allows the user to flip this value using the Flipper::flip message or retrieve the current value using Flipper::get. #[ink::contract] pub mod flipper { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Flipper { value: bool, } impl Flipper { /// Creates a new flipper smart contract initialized with the given value. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(init_value: bool) -> Self { Self { value: init_value } } /// Flips the current value of the Flipper's bool. #[ink(message)] pub fn flip(&mut self) { self.value = !self.value; } /// Returns the current value of the Flipper's bool. #[ink(message)] pub fn get(&self) -> bool { self.value } } } Edit this page Previous Overview Next #[ink(anonymous)] Description Usage Header Arguments compile_as_dependency: bool env: impl Environment Analysis Interacting with the Contract Executor Events Example: Flipper","s":"#[ink::contract]","u":"/macros-attributes/contract","h":"","p":697},{"i":700,"t":"Version: 4.x Hey there reader 👋!

Head over to substrate.stackexchange.com to ask us any questions (there is an ink tag)! ink! 3.0 🦑​ The star of the show this month is the release of ink! 3.0: You can find the release notes here. We've also published a blog post with some more context: ink! 3.0: Parity’s Rust-Based Language for WASM Smart Contracts Gets a Major Update. The team has been working on this release for a while. If you're a developer you're probably aware of this thanks to the long list of release candidates (v3.0.0-rcX) we've pushed out in preparation for the stable 3.0 release. The main idea behind ink! 3.0 is that it's just Rust. The syntax is pretty much identical, and all the tooling you know and love, such as rust-analyzer and Clippy, just works. Some other included changes worth highlighting: Reduced contract sizes for better performance in a parachain context. Support for cross-contract calls, making it easier to write complex applications. Trait support, allowing for a more Rusty development experience. cargo-contract 1.0​ Alongside the release of ink! 3.0 we're also releasing cargo-contract in its first stable version 1.0. cargo-contract is a handy developer tool for building, testing, and deploying ink! contracts. Some notable updates in this release include: Support for uploading and calling contracts on a chain with pallet-contracts. Linting rules for ink! contracts, giving developers warnings about common errors. Delegate Call​ Another update worth pointing out is the addition of delegate_call. What this allows is a way for contracts to forward a call they received to another contract. One use case for this is implementing a Proxy Upgrade Pattern for smart contracts.

Developers can go from an idea to a fully functioning web3 application \"in production\" in a matter of hours or days. This allows faster feedback on ideas, to validate whether there is user demand in the first place, and to easily iterate and refine the implementation. For many applications, smart contracts are good enough. However, they are exposed to the inherent limitations of the smart contract execution environment: Sharing of blockspace with other smart contracts, volatile \"gas\" fees. Default model enforces gas fees being paid by the end user. Relative poor performance of interpreted smart contract (untrusted) code compared to pre-compiled Parachain runtime (trusted) code. Limited access to the host chain environment and any special functionality provided by an extensive suite of customisable FRAME pallets. Once a web3 application has proven it can work, the team may consider \"upgrading\" to a Parachain to unlock the full power of a dedicated App Chain. Compared to developing and deploying a smart contract, this requires considerably more time and expertise, which is why we encourage to start with ink! where possible, at least at the prototype stage. Much of the difficulty in launching a parachain comes in configuring a node implementation, bootstrapping and maintaining a collator network, deploying to testnets, managing infrastructure, acquiring \"Coretime\" (previously via a slot auction). All of which is time consuming and costly. This is important to note because this guide will focus on the migration of the code from ink! to FRAME, which might be a learning curve but overall a minor part of the overall migration, and a one-off cost. Utilizing existing FRAME pallets​ There is a rich library of FRAME pallets, which may provide a drop in replacement for some (or all) of your smart contract functionality. For example, for a PSP22 (similar to ERC20) fungible token contract, this could be replaced either by the native Parachain token itself via pallet_balances or by an asset on pallet_assets. Governance functions could be replaced by e.g. pallet_democracy, and so on. See polkadot-sdk for a range of pre-built pallets which can be used to handle some common functions. Similarities and differences between ink! and FRAME​ Similar​ The biggest advantage we have when migrating from ink! to FRAME is that both are Rust based DSLs, in both cases actual Rust (or Rust-like) code annotated with attributes expands into Rust code for handling all the boilerplate for integrating into their respective execution environments. Indeed the modern FRAME 2.0 was originally inspired by the ink! approach of attribute macros annotating Rust code. So we can assume that the developer performing the migration is already familiar with Rust and its development environment, which is already a huge headstart for developing with FRAME. Next we can assume some familiarity with the execution environment, after all a contract is running inside of pallet_contracts and is invoked in a similar way via a pallet dispatchable, has access to storage (sandboxed to the contract), and can emit events. Different​ The biggest difference is that a contract is user uploaded and therefore untrusted code, so there are restrictions to what the contract is able to do and it will perform slower because it is interpreted. For example, a contract can only read and write from its own sandboxed storage. Runtime code built using FRAME is trusted, can be pre-compiled and therefore executes significantly faster (though that may change if/when contracts are able to target PolkaVM). Pallets have direct access to other pallets and have full access to the Parachain storage, and the permissioning can be configured as desired. Because ink! is executing in a more constrained environment, it is able to be much more opinionated and therefore a simpler language. Because execution is metered (pay as you go execution by the user), there is no need to worry about benchmarking for \"weight\" calculation. FRAME is more powerful, but necessarily more complicated. Example Migration​ We'll use the DNS example contract to demonstrate a migration. Setup​ Start by cloning the Parachain Template which contains a template pallet which we can modify. Now we will move down the contract from top to bottom and begin the migration of code. Event Definitions​ First thing we encounter are events. E.g.: #[ink(event)] pub struct Register { #[ink(topic)] name: Hash, #[ink(topic)] from: AccountId, } Each of these structs annotated with #[ink(event)] can be translated to a variant in the pallet Error enum annotated with #[pallet::error]. Any of the ink! environment type aliases (both Hash and AccountId in the above example) must be translated to their equivalent associated type on the Config trait e.g. AccountId → T::AccountId. Also the #[ink(topic)] annotations must be removed: topics must be calculated manually when the event is emitted, and will be covered later. Remove the #[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)] and the final Event type will look like: #[pallet::event] pub enum Event<T: Config> { Register { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, }, SetAddress { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, old_address: Option<T::AccountId>, new_address: T::AccountId, }, Transfer { name: T::Hash, from: T::AccountId, old_owner: Option<T::AccountId>, new_owner: T::AccountId, } } Storage​ The storage layout of the contract is defined by the following struct: #[ink(storage)] pub struct DomainNameService { /// A hashmap to store all name to addresses mapping. name_to_address: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, /// A hashmap to store all name to owners mapping. name_to_owner: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, /// The default address. default_address: AccountId, } In ink!, the layout of the contract storage is defined by this top level struct. A brief recap of how this is used: Constructors must return an initialized instance of this struct, which is then written to storage. Non mutable messages e.g. #[ink(message)] fn message(&self, ..) will load an instance of this struct and pass it as &self. Mutable messages e.g. #[ink(message)] fn message(&mut self, ..), will load an instance of the struct and persist it if the message succeeds in executing. Fields of type Mapping or Lazy are not written directly into the same storage slot as the parent, but are wrappers around direct reads/writes to storage under many or a single key respectively. In FRAME, all storage operations happen eagerly via \"type aliases\" annotated with #[pallet::storage]. So for each field in the #[ink(storage)] struct, we require a corresponding pallet storage definition. default_address: AccountId translates to: #[pallet::storage] pub type DefaultAddress<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, T::AccountId>; name_to_address: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, translates to a StorageMap like so: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToAddress<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; name_to_owner: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>, also translates to a StorageMap: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToOwner<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; Reading and writing these storage values must all be done explicitly, in contrast with ink! which can do so automatically for non \"lazy\" values. When it comes to migrating the messages, this will be demonstrated. Error Definition​ Simply copy across the variants of the enum Error to the equivalent #[pallet::error] definition. In our case we end up with: #[pallet::error] pub enum Error<T> { /// Returned if the name already exists upon registration. NameAlreadyExists, /// Returned if caller is not owner while required to. CallerIsNotOwner, } Note that the T generic parameter is not used in this case, the error macro handles the generation of PhantomData<T>. If we use some environmental types we can use the T similar to the event definition. Constructors​ In this example, the single constructor is simply initializing the storage to empty values. #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Default::default() } This code is executed when the contract instance was initialized. Our use case is a migration, so we will assume that the existing data must be migrated from contract storage to the pallet storage. This will be covered in the Data Migration section. No code migration is required then for this constructor. Messages​ Mutable​ There are 3 mutable messages (that can change the state of the contract): register, set_address and transfer. This guide will demonstrate register, and the other two can follow a similar pattern. The message is defined as so, with added numerical comments to show the translation to the equivalent FRAME code. #[ink(message)] pub fn register(&mut self, name: Hash) -> Result<()> { // 1. let caller = self.env().caller(); // 2. if self.name_to_owner.contains(name) { return Err(Error::NameAlreadyExists) } // 3. self.name_to_owner.insert(name, &caller); // 4. self.env().emit_event(Register { name, from: caller }); // 5. Ok(()) } Before proceeding, it is necessary to add a custom deposit_event function for raising events which accepts topics: impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> { fn deposit_event(topics: Vec<T::Hash>, event: Event<T>) { <frame_system::Pallet<T>>::deposit_event_indexed( &topics, <T as Config>::RuntimeEvent::from(event).into() ) } } Now we can translate the register message into a \"Dispatchable\": #[pallet::call_index(0)] #[pallet::weight(Weight::from_parts(10_000, 0) .saturating_add(T::DbWeight::get().reads(1)) .saturating_add(T::DbWeight::get().writes(1)))] pub fn register(origin: OriginFor<T>, name: T::Hash) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo { // 1. let caller = ensure_signed(origin)?; // 2. ensure!(!NameToOwner::<T>::contains_key(&name), Error::<T>::NameAlreadyExists); // 3. <NameToOwner<T>>::insert(name, &caller); // 4. Self::deposit_event( &[name.clone(), T::Hashing::hash_of(&caller)], Event::Register { name, from: caller } ); // 5. Ok(().into()) } Compare the numbered annotations from the ink! contract message and the FRAME dispatchable, and you can see they are very similar, just different APIs for interacting with the environment and with storage. For 4., in FRAME we need to generate the topic list manually which is done automatically in ink! via the annotations. Weights​ The pallet::weight attribute defines the weight of the dispatchable i.e. the amount of onchain resources it is estimated to consume. Because we are now writing trusted code, we can define this up front (no runtime gas metering). The number in the weight is typically generated via a benchmarking process. It is important to integrate this process and set a non-arbitrary value here before deploying to a production chain. Read more https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/. Immutable (read only) messages​ ink! messages can return a value, which when executed as an RPC \"dry-run\" (not via a transaction), are used to read the state of contracts. Dispatchables in FRAME cannot return values directly. There are two ways to read the state from a FRAME pallet: Reading from #[pallet::storage] items directly, client libraries will generate an API to do this from the runtime metadata. See e.g. subxt Via runtime APIs, RPC methods that can be wired up directly into query methods on a pallet. See https://docs.substrate.io/reference/runtime-apis/. In our case, 1. is good enough, so the following read only message: #[ink(message)] pub fn get_address(&self, name: Hash) -> AccountId { self.get_address_or_default(name) } fn get_address_or_default(&self, name: Hash) -> AccountId { self.name_to_address .get(name) .unwrap_or(self.default_address) } Can be queried without any modifications to the NameToAddress storage type: #[pallet::storage] pub type NameToAddress<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::Hash, T::AccountId>; subxt would generate the following accessor for querying the storage: let storage_query = my_custom_chain::storage().dns().name_to_address(&name); // Use that query to `fetch` a result. This returns an `Option<_>`, which will be // `None` if no value exists at the given address. You can also use `fetch_default` // where applicable, which will return the default value if none exists. let result = api .storage() .at_latest() .await? .fetch(&storage_query) .await?; Data Migration​ Data migration can be done at either genesis time or once the custom parachain is up and running. Retrieving the data from the contract​ In both cases the first steps are to first download the current state of the contract at a fixed point in time, and then ensuring that no changes can be made to the contract after that. This could be done by using set_code_hash to update the source code of the contract to a special contract which allows only querying and downloading the state of the current contract, and no mutating messages. An alternative would be querying the contract storage directly, but currently there are no good tools for this, and it would require some key calculation for retrieving the data at all storage locations. Additionally the contract would still need to be \"frozen\" somehow to ensure no changes can be made to the contract state. Initializing the pallet​ Once the data has been downloaded and serialized, it can be used to initialize the state of the custom parachain runtime. This can be hardcoded in a #[pallet::genesis_build] impl block. See https://docs.substrate.io/reference/how-to-guides/basics/configure-genesis-state/. Alternatively the state could be initialized via dispatchable extrinsic(s) which initialize the storage. Adjusting UIs​ User interfaces will need to be adjusted to interact with a pallet rather than a contract. This should be relatively straightforward since client libraries usually have first-class support for interacting with Substrate pallets, and the signing etc. should already be integrated.

This API already allows a whole variety of interaction between the contracts-pallet and the executed smart contract. For example it is possible to call and instantiate other smart contracts on the same chain, emit events, query context information or run built-in cryptographic hashing procedures. If this basic set of features is not enough for a particular Substrate built blockchain it is possible to easily extend this API using the so-called chain extension feature. With chain extensions you can expose parts of your runtime logic to smart contract developers. note The ink! repository contains the rand-extension example. This is a complete example of a chain extension implemented in both ink! and Substrate. Structure​ The interface consists of an error code that indicates lightweight errors as well as the definition of some chain extension methods. The overall structure follows that of a simple Rust trait definition. The error code is defined as an associated type definition of the trait definition. The methods are defined as associated trait methods without implementation. Chain extension methods must not have a self receiver such as &self or &mut self and must have inputs and output that implement SCALE codec. Their return value follows specific rules that can be altered using the handle_status attribute and alternation between Result and Non-Result types which are described in more detail below. Usage​ Usually the chain extension definition using this proc. macro is provided by the author of the chain extension in a separate crate. ink! smart contracts using this chain extension simply depend on this crate and use its associated environment definition in order to make use of the methods provided by the chain extension. Attributes​ There are two different attributes with which the chain extension methods can be flagged: Attribute Required Default Value Description ink(extension = N: u32) Yes - Determines the unique function ID of the chain extension method. ink(handle_status = flag: bool) Optional true Assumes that the returned status code of the chain extension method always indicates success and therefore always loads and decodes the output buffer of the call. As with all ink! attributes multiple of them can either appear in a contiguous list: type Access = i32; #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = i32; #[ink(extension = 5, handle_status = false)] fn key_access_for_account(key: &[u8], account: &[u8]) -> Access; } …or as multiple standalone ink! attributes applied to the same item: type Access = i32; #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = i32; #[ink(extension = 5)] #[ink(handle_status = false)] fn key_access_for_account(key: &[u8], account: &[u8]) -> Access; } Details: handle_status​ Default value: true By default all chain extension methods should return a Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>. The Self::ErrorCode represents the error code of the chain extension. This means that a smart contract calling such a chain extension method first queries the returned status code of the chain extension method and only loads and decodes the output if the returned status code indicates a successful call. This design was chosen as it is more efficient when no output besides the error code is required for a chain extension call. When designing a chain extension try to utilize the error code to return errors and only use the output buffer for information that does not fit in a single u32 value. A chain extension method that is flagged with handle_status = false assumes that the returned error code will always indicate success. Therefore it will always load and decode the output buffer and loses the E: From<Self::ErrorCode constraint for the call. Note that if a chain extension method does not return Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>, but handle_status = true it will still return a value of type Result<T, Self::ErrorCode>. Usage: handle_status + Result<T, E> return type​ Use both handle_status = false and non-Result return type for the same chain extension method if a call to it may never fail and never returns a Result type. Combinations​ Due to the possibility to flag a chain extension method with handle_status and either (1) return Result<T, E> or (2) return just T there are 4 different cases with slightly varying semantics: handle_status Returns Result<T, E> Effects true true The chain extension method is required to return a value of type Result<T, E> where E: From<Self::ErrorCode>. A call will always check if the returned status code indicates success and only then will load and decode the value in the output buffer. true false The chain extension method may return any non-Result type. A call will always check if the returned status code indicates success and only then will load and decode the value in the output buffer. The actual return type of the chain extension method is still Result<T, Self::ErrorCode> when the chain extension method was defined to return a value of type T. false true The chain extension method is required to return a value of type Result<T, E>. A call will always assume that the returned status code indicates success and therefore always load and decode the output buffer directly. false false The chain extension method may return any non-Result type. A call will always assume that the returned status code indicates success and therefore always load and decode the output buffer directly. Error Code​ Every chain extension defines exactly one ErrorCode using the following syntax: #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait MyChainExtension { type ErrorCode = MyErrorCode; // more definitions ... } The defined ErrorCode must implement FromStatusCode which should be implemented as a more or less trivial conversion from the u32 status code to a Result<(), Self::ErrorCode>. The Ok(()) value indicates that the call to the chain extension method was successful. By convention an error code of 0 represents success. However, chain extension authors may use whatever suits their needs. Example: Definition​ In the below example a chain extension is defined that allows its users to read and write from and to the runtime storage using access privileges: /// Custom chain extension to read to and write from the runtime. #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait RuntimeReadWrite { type ErrorCode = ReadWriteErrorCode; /// Reads from runtime storage. /// /// # Note /// /// Actually returns a value of type `Result<Vec<u8>, Self::ErrorCode>`. /// #[ink(extension = 1, returns_result = false)] /// fn read(key: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>; /// /// Reads from runtime storage. /// /// Returns the number of bytes read and up to 32 bytes of the /// read value. Unused bytes in the output are set to 0. /// /// # Errors /// /// If the runtime storage cell stores a value that requires more than /// 32 bytes. /// /// # Note /// /// This requires `ReadWriteError` to implement `From<ReadWriteErrorCode>` /// and may potentially return any `Self::ErrorCode` through its return value. #[ink(extension = 2)] fn read_small(key: &[u8]) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError>; /// Writes into runtime storage. /// /// # Note /// /// Actually returns a value of type `Result<(), Self::ErrorCode>`. #[ink(extension = 3)] fn write(key: &[u8], value: &[u8]); /// Returns the access allowed for the key for the caller. /// /// # Note /// /// Assumes to never fail the call and therefore always returns `Option<Access>`. #[ink(extension = 4, handle_status = false)] fn access(key: &[u8]) -> Option<Access>; /// Unlocks previously acquired permission to access key. /// /// # Errors /// /// If the permission was not granted. /// /// # Note /// /// Assumes the call to never fail and therefore does _NOT_ require `UnlockAccessError` /// to implement `From<Self::ErrorCode>` as in the `read_small` method above. #[ink(extension = 5, handle_status = false)] fn unlock_access(key: &[u8], access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError>; } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteErrorCode { InvalidKey, CannotWriteToKey, CannotReadFromKey, } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteError { ErrorCode(ReadWriteErrorCode), BufferTooSmall { required_bytes: u32 }, } impl From<ReadWriteErrorCode> for ReadWriteError { fn from(error_code: ReadWriteErrorCode) -> Self { Self::ErrorCode(error_code) } } impl From<scale::Error> for ReadWriteError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub struct UnlockAccessError { reason: String, } impl From<scale::Error> for UnlockAccessError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum Access { ReadWrite, ReadOnly, WriteOnly, } impl ink::env::chain_extension::FromStatusCode for ReadWriteErrorCode { fn from_status_code(status_code: u32) -> Result<(), Self> { match status_code { 0 => Ok(()), 1 => Err(Self::InvalidKey), 2 => Err(Self::CannotWriteToKey), 3 => Err(Self::CannotReadFromKey), _ => panic!(\"encountered unknown status code\"), } } } All the error types and other utility types used in the chain extension definition above are often required to implement various traits such as SCALE's Encode and Decode as well as scale-info's TypeInfo trait. A full example of the above chain extension definition can be seen here. Example: Environment​ In order to allow ink! smart contracts to use the above defined chain extension it needs to be integrated into an Environment definition as shown below: type RuntimeReadWrite = i32; use ink::env::{Environment, DefaultEnvironment}; pub enum CustomEnvironment {} impl Environment for CustomEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::MAX_EVENT_TOPICS; type AccountId = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::AccountId; type Balance = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Balance; type Hash = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Hash; type BlockNumber = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::BlockNumber; type Timestamp = <DefaultEnvironment as Environment>::Timestamp; type ChainExtension = RuntimeReadWrite; } Above we defined the CustomEnvironment which defaults to ink!'s DefaultEnvironment for all constants and types but the ChainExtension type which is assigned to our newly defined chain extension. Example: Usage​ An ink! smart contract can use the above defined chain extension through the Environment definition defined in the last example section using the env macro parameter as shown below. Note that chain extension methods are accessible through Self::extension() or self.extension(). For example as in Self::extension().read(..) or self.extension().read(..). #[ink::contract(env = CustomEnvironment)] mod read_writer { #[ink(storage)] pub struct ReadWriter {} impl ReadWriter { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self {} } #[ink(message)] pub fn read(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ReadWriteErrorCode> { self.env() .extension() .read(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn read_small(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError> { self.env() .extension() .read_small(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn write( &self, key: Vec<u8>, value: Vec<u8>, ) -> Result<(), ReadWriteErrorCode> { self.env() .extension() .write(&key, &value) } #[ink(message)] pub fn access(&self, key: Vec<u8>) -> Option<Access> { self.env() .extension() .access(&key) } #[ink(message)] pub fn unlock_access(&self, key: Vec<u8>, access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError> { self.env() .extension() .unlock_access(&key, access) } } /// Custom chain extension to read to and write from the runtime. #[ink::chain_extension] pub trait RuntimeReadWrite { type ErrorCode = ReadWriteErrorCode; #[ink(extension = 1)] fn read(key: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>; #[ink(extension = 2)] fn read_small(key: &[u8]) -> Result<(u32, [u8; 32]), ReadWriteError>; #[ink(extension = 3)] fn write(key: &[u8], value: &[u8]); #[ink(extension = 4, handle_status = false)] fn access(key: &[u8]) -> Option<Access>; #[ink(extension = 5, handle_status = false)] fn unlock_access(key: &[u8], access: Access) -> Result<(), UnlockAccessError>; } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteErrorCode { InvalidKey, CannotWriteToKey, CannotReadFromKey, } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum ReadWriteError { ErrorCode(ReadWriteErrorCode), BufferTooSmall { required_bytes: u32 }, } impl From<ReadWriteErrorCode> for ReadWriteError { fn from(error_code: ReadWriteErrorCode) -> Self { Self::ErrorCode(error_code) } } impl From<scale::Error> for ReadWriteError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub struct UnlockAccessError { reason: String, } impl From<scale::Error> for UnlockAccessError { fn from(_: scale::Error) -> Self { panic!(\"encountered unexpected invalid SCALE encoding\") } } #[derive(scale::Encode, scale::Decode, scale_info::TypeInfo)] pub enum Access { ReadWrite, ReadOnly, WriteOnly, } impl ink::env::chain_extension::FromStatusCode for ReadWriteErrorCode { fn from_status_code(status_code: u32) -> Result<(), Self> { match status_code { 0 => Ok(()), 1 => Err(Self::InvalidKey), 2 => Err(Self::CannotWriteToKey), 3 => Err(Self::CannotReadFromKey), _ => panic!(\"encountered unknown status code\"), } } } pub enum CustomEnvironment {} impl ink::env::Environment for CustomEnvironment { const MAX_EVENT_TOPICS: usize = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::MAX_EVENT_TOPICS; type AccountId = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::AccountId; type Balance = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Balance; type Hash = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Hash; type BlockNumber = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::BlockNumber; type Timestamp = <ink::env::DefaultEnvironment as ink::env::Environment>::Timestamp; type ChainExtension = RuntimeReadWrite; } } Technical Limitations​ Due to technical limitations it is not possible to refer to the ErrorCode associated type using Self::ErrorCode anywhere within the chain extension and its defined methods. Instead chain extension authors should directly use the error code type when required. This limitation might be lifted in future versions of ink!. It is not possible to declare other chain extension traits as super traits or super chain extensions of another.

For cargo-contract we released v1.1.1 and v1.2.0 with bug fixes, a new sub-command decode, and improved support for the call and instantiate sub-commands. For tutorials, development and testing we recommend using our substrate-contracts-node. We issued the release v0.13.0, which is in sync with a recent Substrate master (see the release notes for the specific commit hash). Pre-built binaries for the release are available for Linux and Mac. Community Badges 🙌​ We've added two versions of a community badge.

We discussed our roadmap for the rest of this year, as well as some technical designs of how we want to implement e.g. XCM in ink!. We're normally working across different time zones, with some of us embracing the digital nomad lifestyle. Hence it was very productive to gather together for a week. We also did a little hackathon to do some dog-fooding: we've built a dApp that makes use of all components by the above teams. We plan to open source it soon, stay tuned for that 😎. There's a lot on the horizon and we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year! Spanish Twitter Space 🐦​ Hernando was a guest at the spanish Polkadot Twitter Space. The space has been recorded: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnkgmNdBJO. StackExchange Public Beta​ The Substrate & Polkadot StackExchange site has graduated from its private beta ‒ the site is now in public beta! This means that the site is now indexed by search engines and can be browser without any user account. If you have any questions regarding ink! or smart contracts on Substrate this is the place to be. Canvas Update​ You may know that we were working on a common good smart contracts parachain named Canvas. We've decided to put this project on hold. This gives us more room to make ink! and the pallet-contracts as competitive as possible, as well as help parachain teams include those. This is not to say that we'll never get back to Canvas, but as of right now we're no longer working on this project.

It means that whilst subsequent beta releases may contain breaking contract code changes, the ABI will remain the same so that any contract compiled and deployed with v4.0.0-beta continue to be compatible with all future v4.0.0 versions. In order to build contracts which use ink! v4.0.0-beta you need to use cargo-contract v2.0.0-beta. We also released v0.22.1 of the substrate-contracts-node., which is compatible with the v4.0.0-beta release. If you're interested in digging further, check out the relevant CHANGELOGs. Parity Retreat in Sardinia 🌞​ Our team (and Parity as a whole) spent a few days enjoying the warmth and sunshine of Sardinia.

It’s now the third most starred Parity repository on GitHub, after Substrate and Polkadot. We want to say a big “Thank you!” to everyone who contributed in making this happen! Over the last few years we’ve seen contributions in all forms bring the project to where it stands today. Thank you for writing your contracts in ink!, for creating issues and pull requests, for providing us with good and constructive feedback, for answering questions on Substrate StackExchange, for creating third-party tooling for ink!, for writing blog posts about us, and for holding workshops! A lot has happened over the last few years in the ink! world. The first commit was in December 2018 and our current version is v3.3.1. We’re working hard on shipping the next major iteration with v4.0 soon. An open point that comes up regularly is that we’ve never written an article explaining from start to finish what ink! is and how it ties into Substrate and Polkadot. This occasion was a great opportunity to do just that! You can find the article at https://www.parity.io/blog/what-is-paritys-ink. Beyond the Chain ⛓​ ink! core developer Hernando hosted the \"Beyond the Chain\" meetups in Berlin (as part of the Berlin Blockchain Week) and in London. Hernando gave talks about the architecture of Unstoppable Applications, illustrating how the building blocks of Polkadot (like browser-embedded light clients) enable building those. The meetups were packed! On the first floor of our office in Berlin we counted 90+ people. Twitter 🐣​ The bird has hatched! We've set up a Twitter account: @ink_lang, where we'll tweet about anything we find interesting. ink! 4.0 is shaping up 📈​ We've made a couple releases this month: ink! v4.0.0-alpha.3 cargo-contract v2.0.0-alpha.2 cargo-contract v2.0.0-alpha.3 We aim for a stable release of ink! v4.0 and cargo-contract v2.0 in late October.

You can find the tracking issue for ink! 4.0 here. W3F Grant 🙌​ cargo-contract currently requires some external dependencies to be installed by users before they can use it. One of those is wasm-opt, which we use for optimizing the WebAssembly file size of an ink! contract. Having this tool as an external dependency is causing friction for beginners. They have to install it manually and the process varies for each operating system. It bloats up the cargo-contract installation instructions and people not following them properly run into errors because of a missing dependency. Luckily @brson and @aimeedeer have applied for a Web3 Foundation (W3F) grant to fix exactly that for wasm-opt! They've delivered the first milestone ‒ a proof of concept ‒ this month. You can read their summary here. Their next milestone is the integration into cargo-contract which will reduce our installation instructions by one step 🙌!

We were holding lectures on WebAssembly smart contracts as part of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy! This was the first, intentionally low-key, run of a Polkadot education program with an academic focus. This first run was low-key to smooth out the edges and verify if our idea of a curriculum worked out in the real world. It did and there will be many more academies! Starting with the next one, which is happening in January and February 2023 in Buenos Aires. We will also be giving lectures there again! You can find more details on http://dot.li/academy. Astar ported Uniswap v2 to ink! 💱​ Astar has published a showcase dApp built with ink!: a Uniswap-V2 DEX. This is amazing and we can't wait to see where this is going! They are working on a UI for the DEX as well. You can find the repository here: AstarNetwork/wasm-tutorial-dex. Release Updates 🆕​ We've published a release of ink! v3.4 this month. For ink! v4.0 and cargo-contract v2.0 we decided to shift our target release date a bit, to January 2023. There are a number of reasons why we decided to do this: We have made a number of breaking changes and want to wait until popular user interfaces (like polkadot-js or contracts-ui) support those. We want to have a release candidate out for at least some weeks to give everyone the chance to already upgrade tooling and provide feedback. We have an audit going on and would ideally like to incorporate more of the results. A breaking change that has formed in the last weeks is that we will have to remove ink::env::random. This function allowed contract developers getting random entropy. There is unfortunately no way how this can be done safely enough with built-in Substrate primitives on-chain currently. We're following the recommendation of our auditors to remove it. The alternative right now is to provide random entropy off-chain to the contract, to use a random entropy oracle, or to have a chain-extension that does this, in case the chain has a possibility to do so. We hope to bring this function back in a future release of ink!, the best hope right now is that it could come back with Sassafras, a block production protocol for future versions of Polkadot. Conference Season 📢​ Many from our team have been on the road in the last weeks. You might have met us at DappCon, DevCon, or EuroRust. There's more to come and a number of us will be at sub0 in Lisbon at the end of November '22. We have two events scheduled there, a talk and a fireside chat. Come by and talk to us if you're there! Blog Post on wasm-opt-rs 🙌​ Brian Anderson wrote a blog post on his Web3 Foundation grant to get rid of wasm-opt as an external dependency for cargo-contract. This was a contribution that we looked forward to a lot. External dependencies cause so much user friction. For once, it's another manual step in the installation process, which is not always straight forward and different for each operating system. There's other issues too, we don't have control over which version of the dependency is installed on the local system and have to throw errors to the user, causing more user friction. All of this is just solved now by having wasm-opt be a direct dependency of cargo-contract. The blog post is an interesting read, you can find it on Brian's blog here. Solang Solidity compiler incubated into Hyperledger Foundation 🎉​ ink! contracts are executed by Substrate's pallet-contracts; besides ink! there are two other languages that you can use to write smart contracts for this pallet: ask! (Assembly Script) and Solidity via the Solang compiler. Solang supports different blockchains as compiler targets, one of them being pallet-contracts. Our colleague @xermicus is working full-time on this Substrate backend in Solang. The project has now been incubated into the Hyperledger Foundation, hosted by the Linux Foundation. This is a big recognition for the project! In ink!, supporting a symbiotic interaction with Solidity contracts is an important part of the puzzle for us and we're looking forward to the next stages of Solang.

The command will set up the boilerplate code for ink!'s \"Hello, World!\" (the flipper contract)). cargo contract new <contract-name> 2. Build the contract​ cargo contract build 3. Convert Solidity class fields to Rust struct​ Solidity is an object-oriented language, and uses classes. ink! (Rust) does not use classes. An example Solidity class looks like: contract MyContract { bool private _theBool; event UpdatedBool(bool indexed _theBool); constructor(bool theBool_) { require(theBool_ == true, \"theBool_ must start as true\"); _theBool = theBool_; } function setBool(bool newBool) public returns (bool boolChanged) { if _theBool == newBool { boolChanged = false; } else { boolChanged = true; } _theBool = newBool; // emit event UpdatedBool(newBool); } } And the equivalent contract in ink! looks like: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)] use ink_lang as ink; #[ink::contract] mod mycontract { #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { the_bool: bool, // class members become struct fields } #[ink(event)] pub struct UpdatedBool { #[ink(topic)] // -> indexed the_bool: bool, } impl MyContract { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new(the_bool: bool) -> Self { assert!(the_bool == true, \"the_bool must start as true\"); Self { the_bool } } #[ink(message)] // functions become struct implementations pub fn set_bool(&mut self, new_bool: bool) -> bool { let bool_changed = true; if self.the_bool == new_bool{ bool_changed = false; }else{ bool_changed = true; } self.the_bool = new_bool; self.env().emit_event(UpdatedBool { the_bool: new_bool }); // return bool_changed } } } A few key differences are: Solidity class variables / members will be placed in the contract struct in ink! All class methods in Solidity are implemented for the contract struct in ink! Solidity frequently prefixes variables with an underscore (_name). ink! / Rust only prefixes with an underscore for unused variables. Solidity uses camelCase. ink! uses snake_case. In Solidity, the variable type comes before the variable name (e.g. bool myVar). While ink! specifies var type after the var name (e.g. my_var: bool) 4. Convert each function​ Start converting each function one by one. A recommended approach is to, if possible, skip cross-contract calls at first and use mock data instead This way off-chain unit tests can be written to test the core functionality unit tests are off-chain and do not work with cross-contract calls Once fully tested, start adding in cross-contract calls and perform on-chain manual + integration tests Ensure that function's visibility (public, private) are matched in ink! In Solidity, if a function returns a bool success, ink! will use a Result<()> instead (Result::Ok or Result::Err). Solidity return example: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.1; contract Example { uint128 public data; constructor(){} function setData(uint128 newData) public returns ( bool success, string memory reason ) { if (newData == 0) { return (false, \"Data should not be zero\"); } data = newData; return (true, \"\"); } } The equivalent contract in ink!: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] #[ink::contract] mod example { #[ink(storage)] pub struct Example { data: u128, } #[derive(Debug, scale::Encode, scale::Decode, PartialEq, Eq)] #[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))] pub enum Error { DataShouldNotBeZero, } pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>; impl Example { #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { data: 0 } } #[ink(message)] pub fn set_data(&mut self, new_data: u128) -> Result<()> { if new_data == 0 { return Err(Error::DataShouldNotBeZero); } self.data = new_data; Ok(()) } } } Best Practices + Tips​ If the Solidity contract uses a string, it is recommended to use a Vec<u8> to avoid the overhead of a String. See here for more details on why. The smart contract should only contain the information that strictly needs to be placed on the blockchain and go through consensus. The UI should be used for displaying strings. Double check all .unwrap()s performed. Solidity does not have as strict checking as ink! does. For example, a mapping field can be accessed as simple as myMapping[someKey]. ink!, however, requires self.my_mapping.get(some_key).unwrap(). A useful way to handle None cases is to use .unwrap_or(some_val). Run the contracts node with substrate-contracts-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug for debug prints, and errors to be displayed in the nodes console. When passing parameters to a helper, it is recommended to pass references (even for primitives) as Wasm is more efficient with references. For example (see erc20 example): /// Returns the account balance for the specified `owner`. /// /// Returns `0` if the account is non-existent. #[ink(message)] pub fn balance_of(&self, owner: AccountId) -> Balance { self.balance_of_impl(&owner) } /// Returns the account balance for the specified `owner`. /// /// Returns `0` if the account is non-existent. /// /// # Note /// /// Prefer to call this method over `balance_of` since this /// works using references which are more efficient in Wasm. #[inline] fn balance_of_impl(&self, owner: &AccountId) -> Balance { self.balances.get(owner).unwrap_or_default() } Just as in Solidity, ink! does not have floating point numbers due to the non-deterministic nature. Instead, the frontend should add decimal points as needed. Syntax Equivalencies​ public function​ // solidity function fnName() public {} // or // by default, functions are public function fnName() {} // ink! #[ink(message)] pub fn fn_name(&self) {} mapping declaration​ // solidity mapping(address => uint128) private mapName; //ink! use ink_storage::{ traits::SpreadAllocate, Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] #[derive(SpreadAllocate)] pub struct ContractName { map_name: Mapping<AccountId, u128>, } When using a map in ink!, ink_lang::utils::initialize_contract must be used in the constructor. See here for more details. mapping usage​ // solidity // insert / update aMap[aKey] = aValue; // get aMap[aKey] // ink! //insert / update self.a_map.insert(&a_key, &a_value); // get self.a_map.get(a_key).unwrap() struct​ // solidity struct MyPerson{ address person; u64 favNum; } // ink! struct MyPerson { person: AccountId, fav_num: u64, } assertions / requires​ // solidity require(someValue < 10, \"someValue is not less than 10\"); // ink! assert!(some_value < 10, \"some_value is not less than 10\"); timestamp​ // solidity block.timestamp // ink! self.env().block_timestamp() contract caller​ // solidity address caller = msg.sender; // ink! let caller: AccountId = self.env().caller(); contract's address​ // solidity address(this) // ink! self.env().account_id() bytes​ Solidity has a type bytes. bytes is (essentially) equivalent to an array of uint8. So, bytes in Solidity => Vec<u8> or [u8; ...] in ink!. See here for more details. If desired, a bytes struct can be created in ink! to replicate the bytes type in Solidity. uint256​ Solidity uses uint256 and uint to represent a 256-bit type. Solidity is 256-bit / 32-byte word optimized. Meaning, using uint256 in Solidity contracts will reduce gas usage -- but increase storage usage. The largest size ink! has built in is a u128. ink! compiles to Wasm. The largest primitive Wasm has is 64bit (due to most computers using 64bit). So, there is no benefit to using any larger primitive over a collection. When porting a uint256 from Solidity to ink!, it is recommended to, with discretion, determine the range of the value, and choose the appropriate size (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128). If a 256-bit hash value is required, ink! has a Hash primitive available. In the event a value needs to be 256-bit, it is recommended to use an array (e.g. [u64; 4]). payable​ // solidity function myFunction() payable returns (uint64) {} #[ink(message, payable)] pub fn my_function(&self) -> u64 {} received deposit / payment​ // solidity msg.value // ink! self.env().transferred_value() contract balance​ // solidity address(this).balance // ink! self.env().balance() transfer tokens from contract​ // solidity recipient.send(amount) // ink! if self.env().transfer(recipient, amount).is_err() { panic!(\"error transferring\") } events & indexed​ // solidity event MyCoolEvent( u128 indexed indexedValue, u128 notIndexedValue, ); // emit event emit MyCoolEvent(someValue, someOtherValue); // ink! #[ink(event)] pub struct MyCoolEvent { #[ink(topic)] indexed_value: u128, not_indexed_value: u128, } // emit event self.env().emit_event(MyCoolEvent { indexed_value: some_value, not_indexed_value: some_other_value }); errors and returning​ Solidity has several error handling mechanisms: assert, require, revert, and throw. Each of these will revert the changed state when called. See this article for details on these. ink! uses a Result enum (Ok(T), Err(E)), assert! and panic!. This Stack Exchange answer and GitHub discussion provide more details on these. throw​ Throw is deprecated in Solidity and would throw an invalid opcode error (no details) and revert the state. As an alternative to the if...{throw;} pattern in Solidity, a Result::Err should be returned for expected errors, and an assert! should be used for errors that should not occur. assert​ In Solidity, assert is used as internal guards against errors in the code. In general, properly functioning code should never hit a failing assert. assert in Solidity does not have error strings. In ink!, use assert!. assert! will panic! if it evaluates to false. The state will be reverted, and a CalleeTrapped will be returned. The (optional) error string will be printed to the debug buffer. // ink! assert!(caller == owner, \"caller is not owner\") require and revert​ In Solidity, require is used for general (normal) errors -- such as errors that occur based on user input. require does have the option for an error string. revert is very similar to require except that revert will be called in if ... else chains. Both require and revert will revert the chain state. In ink!, if ... { return Err(Error::SomeError) } should be used for require or revert. When a Result::Err is returned in ink!, then all state is reverted. In general, Result::Err should be used when a calling contract needs to know why a function failed. Otherwise, assert! should be used as it has less overhead than a Result. // Solidity function myFunction(bool returnError) public pure { require(!returnError, \"my error here\"); // or if returnError { revert(\"my error here\"); } } // ink! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)] #[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))] pub enum Error { /// Provide a detailed comment on the error MyError, } // result type pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>; // ... #[ink(message)] pub fn my_function(&self, return_error: bool) -> Result<()> { if return_error{ return Err(Error::MyError) } Ok(()) } nested mappings + custom / advanced structures​ In Solidity, it is easy to do nested mappings. It is not as straightforward in ink!. imagine the following scenario // solidity contract Dao { struct Proposal { mapping (address => bool) votedYes } mapping (address => bool) public isWhitelisted; Proposal[] public proposals; } in ink! this seems like it could be represented like so: #[ink::contract] mod dao { use ink::{ prelude::vec::Vec, storage::Mapping, }; #[ink(storage)] pub struct Proposal { voted_yes: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } #[ink(storage)] pub struct Dao { proposals: Vec<Proposal>, is_whitelisted: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } impl Dao{ #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { is_whitelisted: Mapping::default(), proposals: Vec::new(), } } } } However, this will cause an error due to the nested mapping. This answer explains in detail why nested mappings are not allowed So, as of now, to get around this issue an alternate data structure will need to be used. A data-structure that can be interchanged with the Mapping syntax and with minimal additional implementations is the BTreeMap. BTreeMap is less efficient than Mapping, but is an easy workaround until nested mappings are allowed. This will be used in the nested struct. Additional derives will need to be added to be compatible with the #[ink(storage)] struct (see below). #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] #[ink::contract] mod dao { use ink::{ prelude::{ collections::BTreeMap, vec::Vec, }, storage::Mapping, }; #[derive( scale::Encode, scale::Decode, Debug, )] #[cfg_attr( feature = \"std\", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo) )] pub struct Proposal { voted_yes: BTreeMap<AccountId, bool>, } #[ink(storage)] #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Dao { proposals: Vec<Proposal>, is_whitelisted: Mapping<AccountId, bool>, } impl Dao{ #[ink(constructor)] pub fn new() -> Self { Self { is_whitelisted: Mapping::default(), proposals: Vec::new(), } } #[ink(message)] pub fn add_proposal(&mut self) { self.proposals.push(Proposal { voted_yes: BTreeMap::new(), }); } #[ink(message)] pub fn vote(&mut self, proposal_id: u32, vote: bool) { let proposal = self.proposals .get_mut(proposal_id as usize) .unwrap(); proposal.voted_yes .insert(Self::env().caller(), vote); } #[ink(message)] pub fn get_proposal(&self, proposal_id: u32) -> BTreeMap<AccountId, bool> { self.proposals .get(proposal_id as usize) .unwrap() .voted_yes .clone() } } } cross-contract calling​ In ink!, to do cross-contract calling, the contract will need to be added to the project. Ensure the contract is properly exporting its Structs. See the erc20 contract example: #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] // make the structs visible pub use self::erc20::{ Erc20, // this is necessary Erc20Ref, }; #[ink::contract] pub mod erc20 {} In the new cross-called contract's Cargo.toml, add (or edit) the following: [lib] name = \"erc20\" path = \"lib.rs\" crate-type = [ # Used for normal contract Wasm blobs. \"cdylib\", # Used for ABI generation. Necessary for importing as a dependency \"rlib\", ] [features] ink-as-dependency = [] ink-as-dependency \"tells the ink! code generator to always or never compile the smart contract as if it was used as a dependency of another ink! smart contract\" (source). Then, In the main contract's Cargo.toml, import the contract that will be cross-called. erc20 = { path = \"erc20\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] } And make sure to add it to the std field of the .toml file. [features] default = [\"std\"] std = [ # ... \"erc20/std\", ] Now, import the cross-called-contract to the main contract: // example use erc20::Erc20Ref; There are two methods to setup the other contract. Instantiate the cross-called-contract in the main contract's constructor. See here for a tutorial, and here for an example. Or, add the AccountId of an already deployed contract. Here is an example constructor to set this up: use my_other_contract::MyOtherContractRef; // ... fn new(contract_id: AccountId) -> Self { // for already deployed contract let contract_ref: MyOtherContractRef = ink_env::call::FromAccountId::from_account_id(contract_id); Self {contract_ref} } Now, to perform the cross-contract call: { self.contract_ref.some_external_function(a_param); } Note: as of now (ink! v3.3.1), when using cross-contract calls, emitting events will not work and compile errors will occur. See issue #1000. Furthermore, the compiler will throw an error saying that (for example) Erc20Ref does not implement SpreadAllocate. This issue #1149 explains more and has a workaround. These issues will be fixed in issue #1134. submit generic transaction / dynamic cross-contract calling​ // solidity // invokes function found at`addr`, sends the `_amount` to the `addr`, and the `_transactionData` payload. addr.call.value(_amount)(_transactionData) // ink! // ... use ink_env::call::{ build_call, Call, ExecutionInput, Selector, }; /// A wrapper that allows us to encode a blob of bytes. /// /// We use this to pass the set of untyped (bytes) parameters to the `CallBuilder`. struct CallInput<'a>(&'a [u8]); impl<'a> scale::Encode for CallInput<'a> { fn encode_to<T: Output + ?Sized>(&self, dest: &mut T) { dest.write(self.0); } } // ... // see: https://github.com/paritytech/ink-examples/blob/main/multisig/lib.rs#L535 fn invoke_transaction( &mut self, callee: AccountId, transfer_amount: u128, function_selector: [u8; 4], transaction_data: Vec<u8>, gas_limit: u64) -> Result<()> { let result = build_call::<<Self as ::ink_lang::reflect::ContractEnv>::Env>() .call_type( Call::new() .callee(callee) // contract to call .gas_limit(*gas_limit) .transferred_value(transfer_amount), // value to transfer with call ) .exec_input( ExecutionInput::new(Selector::from(*function_selector)) .push_arg(CallInput(transaction_data)), // SCALE-encoded parameters ) .returns::<()>() .fire() .map_err(|_| Error::TransactionFailed); result } Note: the function_selector bytes can be found in the generated target/ink/<contract-name>.json. Limitations of ink! v3​ Multi-file projects are not supported with pure ink! implementing traits / interfaces will not work There are alternatives that do add this functionality such as OpenBrush Nested structs and data structures can be difficult to use Cross-contract calling prevents events from being emitted. See here for details. Cross-contract calling can not be tested off-chain with unit tests. On-chain integration tests will need to be used. Troubleshooting Errors​ ERROR: Validation of the Wasm failed. ERROR: Validation of the Wasm failed. ERROR: An unexpected panic function import was found in the contract Wasm. This typically goes back to a known bug in the Rust compiler: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78744 As a workaround try to insert `overflow-checks = false` into your `Cargo.toml`. This will disable safe math operations, but unfortunately we are currently not aware of a better workaround until the bug in the compiler is fixed. Solution Add the following to the contract Cargo.toml: [profile.release] overflow-checks = false \"failed to load bitcode of module '...' \" This happens when trying to import a contract for cross-contract calling. Solution Ensure that the following is added to Cargo.toml contract import:` features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"] so the import would look like: mycontract = { path = \"mycontract/\", default-features = false, features = [\"ink-as-dependency\"]} unit testing (off-chain)​ Unit tests are an integral part of smart-contract development and ensuring your code works off-chain before testing on-chain. To run ink! tests, use the command cargo test. Add the --nocapture flag for debug prints to show. From the contract module, make sure to make the contract struct and anything else that is going to be used in the unit tests public. For example: // top of file #![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std, no_main)] pub use self::mycontract::{ MyContract }; Off-chain unit tests will not work with cross-contract calls. One workaround to ensure unit tests are still passing is to provide mock data. An easy approach is to use conditional compiling with #[cfg(test)] and #[cfg(not(test))]. Note: This solution may not be the best option. A more effective approach can be found in our current E2E test. Please refer to the showcased example here. For example, here is a read-only ERC20 cross-contract call: // only compiles when *not* running tests #[cfg(not(test))] fn get_token_balance(&self, caller: &AccountId) -> Balance { // calls the external ERC-20 contract self.token.balance_of(*caller) } // only compiles when running tests #[cfg(test)] fn get_token_balance(&self, _: &AccountId) -> Balance { // arbitrary value 1 } And if the cross-contract call writes to storage, a mock field can be added to the contract struct. For example: #[ink(storage)] pub struct MyContract { #[cfg(test)] mock_field: SomeStruct, // will serve as a fake storage } ... // on-chain, performs cross-contract call #[cfg(not(test))] fn do_some_write(&mut self) { self.external_contract.write_to_field(0xDEADBEEF); } // testing environment only #[cfg(test)] fn do_some_write(&mut self) { self.mock_field.my_fake_storage_item = 0xDEADBEEF; } useful code to interact and modify the contract environment for testing ink_env docs // get the default accounts (alice, bob, ...) let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); accounts.alice //usage example // set which account calls the contract ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.bob); // get the contract's address let callee = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); // set the contracts address. // by default, this is alice's account ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(callee); // transfer native currency to the contract ink::env::test::set_value_transferred::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(2); // increase block number (and block timestamp). // this can be placed in a loop to advance the block many times ink::env::test::advance_block::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(); // generate arbitrary AccountId AccountId::from([0x01; 32]); // generate arbitrary Hash Hash::from([0x01; 32]) // macro for tests that are expected to panic. #[should_panic] Edit this page Previous How it Works – Substrate Next ink! vs. CosmWasm Solidity to ink!

The distinction here is that in the context of Polkadot and Kusama a parachain leases a slot for a couple of months for up to two years. The deal with a lease is that the parachain gets a fixed slot for executing its business logic (typically referred to as its state transition function) and can persist its modified state in a block. In Substrate terminology this state transition function is called the chain's runtime. The distinction to other ecosystems here is that, in the context of Polkadot, parachains and smart contracts exist at different layers of the stack: smart contracts sit on top of parachains. Parachains would usually be described as layer-1 blockchains ‒ except for that they don't have to build their own security, are upgradable, and interoperable. It's noteworthy that a parachain's state transition function doesn't get further validated ‒ it's up to the parachain how it utilizes its slot time. The parachain already pre-paid for its slot when it won the slot auction on Polkadot or Kusama. This means the parachain can build its own (blockchain) world! For example, it can decide on how transaction fees are charged ‒ or even if transaction fees are charged at all. These options are crucial when building new or more user-friendly business models. Other distinguishing factors between parachains that we observe in the wild are differences in how governance works or the crypto-economics. There are some constraints on how the parachain can build its world though. Like physics in the real world it has to adhere to certain ground rules. For Polkadot and Kusama that's for example the consensus algorithm for the Relay Chain to communicate with the parachain. From those ground rules the advantages of Polkadot and Kusama emerge. Advantages like the aforementioned shared security, cross-chain communication, or guaranteed execution slot time. For smart contracts, on the other hand, an existing parachain has to include the pallet-contracts for users to deploy smart contracts. The deployed smart contract is always untrusted code. Anyone (or any program) that has tokens of the chain can upload a smart contract without requiring permission. Smart contracts allow permissionless deployment of untrusted programs on a blockchain. The pallet-contracts has to assume that these programs are adversarial, it has to put a number of safety pillars in place to ensure that the contract can not e.g. stall the chain or cause state corruption of other contracts. For pallet-contracts those safety pillars include mechanisms like gas metering or deposits for storing data on-chain. To restate this important distinction: developing a parachain runtime is different from developing a smart contract ‒ a smart contract sits on top of a parachain. The trade-off is that with a parachain one has the freedom to decide on (nearly) all the rules that make up the parachain. With a smart contract one is constrained by what the chain allows and the safety pillars that necessarily have to be in place. A smart contract can never be as fast as a native pallet built in the parachain runtime ‒ there is too much logic in between. A smart contract on the other hand has less friction for developing and deploying it. Developers don't have to take care of governance, crypto-economics, etc. One just needs a few tokens and can go on its merry way deploying a smart contract. It's as simple as that.

We have a live testnet named Contracts as a parachain online there. What is the Contracts parachain?​ It's a Substrate parachain for smart contracts. We configured it to use Substrate's smart contracts module – the contracts pallet – in a default configuration. The code for this parachain can be found in the cumulus repository. Our parachain uses the Rococo relay chain's native token (ROC) instead of having its own token. Due to this you'll need ROC in order to deploy contracts on our testnet. How can I use it?​ (1) Create an Account​ As a first step, you should create an account. This can be done via command-line tools (e.g. subxt) or via a wallet (e.g. with the polkadot-js browser extension). See here for a detailed guide. (2) Get Testnet Tokens​ As a second step, you have to get ROC testnet tokens through the Rococo Faucet. Alternatively, you can use the Element chat room. You must send a message like this (Note the :1002 after the wallet address): !drip YOUR_SS_58_ADDRESS:1002 The number 1002 is the parachain ID of Contracts on Rococo, by supplying it you instruct the faucet to teleport ROC tokens directly to your account on the parachain. If you have some tokens on the Rococo relay chain, you can teleport them to the Contracts parachain on your own. Read more on teleporting assets here. If everything worked out, the teleported ROC tokens will show up in your account. In case you are using the polkadot-js frontend, you can see them under the \"Accounts\" tab for Contracts. (3) Deploy Your Contract​ Once you have ROC on Contracts you can deploy a contract nearly as you would with a local developer node. The only difference is that you can't use pre-endowed accounts like Alice or Bob, you have to use the one you generated instead. You can also deploy your contract from the command-line via cargo-contract. Make sure you are in the folder of your contract and that it has been built recently. Then execute: cargo contract upload --suri \"your twelve or twenty-four words\" cargo contract instantiate --suri … --constructor new --args true new in this case would be a constructor method exposed by the contract, --args would be any arguments the constructor expects. See the cargo-contract docs for a more detailed documentation. Edit this page Previous Kickstart your project! Next Faucet What is the Contracts parachain? How can I use it?

Version: 4.x Why Rust for Smart Contracts? ink! chooses not to invent a new programming language, but rather adapt a subset of Rust to serve our purpose. If this doesn't already convince you, you find many more good reasons here: Rust is an ideal smart contract language: It is type safe, memory safe, and free of undefined behaviors. It generates small binaries because it doesn’t include extra bloat, like a garbage collector, and advanced optimizations and tree shaking remove dead code. Through compiler flags, Rust can automatically protect against integer overflow. Rust ecosystem: You gain from all of the support available to the Rust ecosystem for free. As the language develops, ink! will automatically gain access to new features and functionality, improving how you can write smart contracts in the future. Tooling: Because ink! follows Rust standards, tools like rustfmt, clippy and rust-analyzer already work out of the box. The same goes for code formatting and syntax highlighting in most modern text editors. Also, Rust has an integrated test and benchmark runner, No overhead: Minimal runtime. Safe & Efficient: Zero-cost & safe abstractions. Productive: Cargo + crates.io Ecosystem. 1st class Wasm: Rust provides the first class support for the WebAssembly. Small Size: In the space-constrained blockchain world size is important. The Rust compiler is a great help for that, since it reorders struct fields in order to make each type as small as possible. Thus, Rust data structures are very compact, in many cases even more compact than in C. Edit this page Previous Welcome! Next Why WebAssembly for Smart Contracts?","s":"Why Rust for Smart Contracts?","u":"/why-rust-for-smart-contracts","h":"","p":743},{"i":746,"t":"Overview Why WebAssembly for Smart Contracts? Version: 4.x Why WebAssembly for Smart Contracts? We made a conscious decision for WebAssembly as the target architecture of ink!. Our decision was made up by these reasons: High performance: Wasm is high performance — it’s built to be as close to native machine code as possible while still being platform independent. Small size: It facilitates small binaries to ship over the internet to devices with potentially slow internet connection. This is a great fit for the space-constrained blockchain world. General VM & bytecode: It was developed so that code can be deployed in any browser with the same result. Contrary to the EVM it was not developed towards a very specific use case, this has the benefit of a lot of tooling being available and large companies putting a lot of resources into furthering Wasm development. Efficient JIT execution: 64 and 32-bit integer operation support that maps one-to-one with CPU instructions. Minimalistic: Formal spec that fits on a single page. Deterministic execution: Wasm is easily made deterministic by removing floating point operations, which is necessary for consensus algorithms. Open Standards > Custom Solutions: Wasm is a standard for web browsers developed by W3C workgroup that includes Google, Mozilla, and others. There’s been many years of work put into Wasm, both by compiler and standardization teams. Many languages available: Wasm expands the family of languages available to smart contract developers to include Rust, C/C++, C#, Typescript, Haxe, and Kotlin. This means you can write smart contracts in whichever language you’re familiar with, though we’re partial to Rust due to its lack of runtime overhead and inherent security properties. Memory-safe, sandboxed, and platform-independent. LLVM support: Supported by the LLVM compiler infrastructure project, meaning that Wasm benefits from over a decade of LLVM’s compiler optimization.
